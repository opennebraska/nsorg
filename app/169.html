This is the model of development that GESU follows, investment into a neighborhood which in turn is an investment into the community.  GESU 's vision is to transform neighborhoods by creating a viable, stable, safe environment for families to grow and flourish. GESU is also providing a financing process that will assist potential homeowners in gaining  equity in a short time as well as developing an asset that can be utilized to build wealth.

GESU will provide down payment assistance, enabling more families to participate in the purchase of a home, gaining equity without creating additional financial burdens and stabilizing neighborhoods with quality affordable housing stock. Vacant land is in abundance in the North Omaha area, creating areas of crime, vandalism, neglect and neighborhood deterioration.

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> construction funding</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> The number of houses can be reduced, however, the costs will increase because supplies or materials may increase because of the reduction in quantity.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> GESU is committing  100,000 in equity derived from previous developments.  GESU does not maintain a balance of funds.  We have fundraised continually to support projects.  Because the development cost exceeds the sale price, the fundraised dollars go to the loss derived from producing the affordable units.  There is  no profit for GESU other than a developer fee per house.  GESU has partnered with the City of Omaha for 18 years using NAHTF and HOME funds to construct the housing.  Usually, GESU has fundraised to contribute 75-80,000 per house toward the construction.</p>
