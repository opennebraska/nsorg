  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> NODO, LLC, which is wholly owned by White Lotus Group (“WLG”), is requesting an award of funds via the Omaha Economic Recovery Grant to complete its capital stack for renovation and development of the three-story building (the “Orchard & Wilhelm Warehouse”) at 1113 Nicholas Street in North Omaha.  As a part of the Millwork Commons District, the Orchard and Wilhelm Warehouse sits in a developing neighborhood ripe with investment and growth, and the renovation and revitalization of the building to create flexible office space will add another component to this neighborhood’s success story.   

The Orchard & Wilhelm Warehouse, originally constructed in 1893, held no regular tenant and was in a state of disrepair when WLG acquired it two years ago.  The exterior façade has been overlayed with stucco, covering up deteriorated masonry, while boards cover most windows.  Inside, a load-bearing wall divides the center, but the floorplates themselves remain open.   Per the Nicholas Street Historic District Nomination Form, the building maintains a fair amount of integrity for its age, and its loss would create a gap in the district.  

WLG has conducted necessary due diligence on the site, having previously commissioned/obtained an ALTA Survey and Phase I Report.  As a part of our capital stack, we have begun the process to utilize federal and state historic tax credits by confirming the building contributes to the Nicholas Street Historic District, and engaging Alley Poyner Macchietto Architects to prepare design plans that will satisfy Part 2 of the HTC Application.  Additionally, we’ve confirmed with the City this building sits within the CRA, making it eligible for Tax Increment Financing.   

With an award of the Omaha Economic Recovery Grant, our capital stack will be fully complete, and we’d expect to commence development immediately, with a 14-month construction period finishing in the first half of 2024.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> See attached “NODO (Orchard & Wilhelm Warehouse) – Construction Timeline”, but note project will be completed by April 1, 2024.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We plan to renovate the Orchard & Wilhelm Warehouse into flexible commercial workspace, envisioning multiple set ups based on tenancy, including three floors of flexible office space.  This project will serve a variety of the North Omaha community’s needs, including (1) investment in a structure that has been underutilized (with continued vacancy risking demolition), (2) continuing the redevelopment of the Millwork Commons District, running on a similar timeline to the new Dizzy Mule development, (3) providing affordable commercial space by utilizing ARPA funds to lower the all-in cost to build, (4) development of office space along a multi-modal transportation route, with Cuming Street to the south, Route 13 of the METRO line running just west of the building on 12th street, and the new Omaha Streetcar line ending three blocks to the south, and (5) providing office space and jobs directly to the North Omaha area.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> 1.	Redevelopment of a culturally significant property by preserving the “Orchard & Wilhelm Warehouse” historic building, a structure originally built in 1893.  Per the Nicholas Street Historic District designation, the building is contributing property to the district.  Without redevelopment, the structure is likely to remain vacant and could risk demolition.
2.	Proximity to workforce, attempting to assist no-car households via location of employment, and developing along Metro bus route. 
3.	Bringing flexible office space directly into North Omaha to generate jobs and workspace.
4.	Marketing to the community, presenting office space in North Omaha with ease of location and flexibility to adapt to needs of business owner. 
5.	Costs of construction, using ARPA funds to lower overall investment of development, allowing for more flexible leasing opportunities.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Leveraging ARPA funds to continue development into North Omaha without displacement, eliminating blighted structure which had become a visual eyesore and anchored an entire block of stagnant development.  Instead of unappealing structure or future vacant land, historic rehabilitation of building will enhance safety of the area which includes The Mastercraft, Hello Apartments and the Ashton, further spurring connectivity between downtown Omaha and the North Omaha community.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The economic impact should not be simply weighted by the redevelopment project, but the affordability of the office space created by utilizing ARPA funds to lower overall investment into the project.  See below:</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 80</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 30</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> $15-$50 per hour (construction jobs) / $20-$75 per house (permanent jobs)</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We will have an open competitive bidding process, for both General Contractor and Subcontractors, allowing for minority owned and local North Omaha contractors to bid and have a direct impact on the project.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The development of the Orchard & Wilhelm Warehouse will mark another construction project for the Millwork Commons District.  The surrounding district has seen The Mastercraft, Hello Apartments and the Ashton recently developed.  Additionally, new construction is taking place across 12th street (to our west), with the Dizzy Mule project.   We plan to rehabilitate the interior and exterior of the building to a standard that will qualify for federal and state historic tax credits.  This will require substantial rehabilitation to the exterior façade of the building, including removal of the stucco facade, and refurbishment of the masonry walls.  This office space will provide entrepreneurs from North Omaha a place to work, enhance their products/employees, and ultimately use those tools to further invest in/grow the community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> We own the lot immediately adjacent to the east of the Orchard and Wilhelm Warehouse, as well as the two lots adjacent to 12th street to the west.   Ownership of all lots will allow WLG to create nearly 2 blocks of updated streetscape, lit parking, and building renovation/development.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Newly designed, flexible workspace to the North Omaha area. An example of adaptive use to a previously unused structure, highlighting how investment dollars can produce results.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Enhancement of building in disrepair (interior and exterior).  Enhancement of block through lighting/streetscape, displacement of trash and debris.  Generation of North Omaha office / mixed use space, allowing for creativity in design driven by the users themselves.  By keeping workspace in North Omaha, goal would be to attract employers in the area, who then themselves look to same community to bring in employees.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Measurement of these benefits can occur through monitoring of building lease up, how many of tenants are startups, how many employees live in the area (measured by the Omaha chamber).</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, we believe this project will prove further investment in the North Omaha area is warranted, either through development of vacant/underutilized land, or investment in North Omaha businesses.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> We plan to utilize our relationships with Metro Community College, Spark CDI, Provent Ventures, Charles Drew Health and Empowerment Network. All of these organizations are ones White Lotus Group has either worked with on other projects, or started the process of engaging for lease-up in this space.</p>
