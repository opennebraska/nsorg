  <h3>TeamExplanation</h3>
  <p> Yes, the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation’s Board of Directors, and three paid staff members currently oversee our development and operations. We are currently seeking to expand our team by re-initiating our work with Schemmer and Associates firm who originally drafted our strategic and master plan in 2012. Recently they have submitted a proposal for services should we decide to move forward in their leadership in completing this work.</p>

  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> MXMF is governed by an 11-seat board of directors with a hired executive director. The executive director manages all staff including a Grant writer, executive secretary, policy fellow and tour director. Lastly, the tour director instructs projects for the volunteers. No other positions exist at this time.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The Malcolm X Memorial organization has been in existence since 1971. In 1986, Articles of Incorporation as a 501(c)(3) corporation were enacted to be operated exclusively for charitable, educational, religious or scientific purposes. Malcolm X home site at 3448 Pinkney Street was purchased, followed by acquiring all the other surrounding properties. In 2000, grading of the 9.62 acre site commenced. This development significantly altered the terrain, vacating existing streets through the area and resulting in a large unobstructed area for future development. Other vacated residential properties were acquired north of Evans Street and immediately north of Bedford Avenue. Construction of the plaza on the Malcolm X home site occurred in 2008. In 2010, the former church on Evans Street was acquired for use as the MXMF Visitors Center. Commissioned and completed preliminary Master Plan study by Schemmer & Associates 2011. 2012 complete handicap accessible ramp to the Plaza Area of the MXMF home site. In 2018, we added a semi-permanent art installation of a mixed-used pavilion and greenhouse space. The same year we completed a 1/2 acre community garden installation. During the pandemic we successfully hosted a rally of over 2000+ visitors maintaining peace in the city during the aftermath of George Floyd. During 2021, building improvements were made to the Visitors Center including replacing lighting and roofing. Annually, we have increased our capacity to host tours to the visiting public both nationally and internationally. In 2021, we received 3,400 travelers plus approximately 2,000 during the 2nd annual Juneteenth outdoor celebration. Finally we have increased our property footprint to extend to 18 acres of land dating back to 1971.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Malcolm X Memorial Foundation (MXMF) is a 51 year old institution in the heart of North Omaha, and the Qualified Census Tract (according to these funding requirements). MXMF is a historical, cultural, & education center. MXMF is home to the historical birthsite of human rights leader Malcolm X. MXMF has an $18 million development plan that provides jobs, increased traffic via tourism to North Omaha, and improved quality of life for all surrounding residents. The timeline of our master plan is approximately 8 years and could be accelerated with strategic partnerships. Located at 3448 Evans Street in North Omaha, our plans include an improved Visitors Center, Bed Breakfast & Retreat Center, Outdoor Amphitheater, lighted & paved walkable landscape, Conference and Cultural center and Housing development. 

In light of recent recognition to add Malcolm X into the Nebraska Hall of Fame, we must recognize the importance of having a strong dedicated tourist destination and cultural hub in the heart of North Omaha that reflects the vision to grow and empower the next generation. This kind of increased development opportunity would allow multiple organizations in North Omaha to serve one another in a more impactful way for decades to come.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The $18 million MXMF Master plan includes various attractions to fulfill the mission of our organization and furthermore provide jobs, culturally relevant development, housing, and economic stimulus to the area. Jobs will be provided through construction of the various facilities outlined in MXMF's Master Plan, as well as the ongoing program and operation support to sustain the developments. MXMF's Master Plan is adjacent to the North of Adams Park. MXMF's Master Plan includes a walking trail and bike path across a 9+ acre span. This enhances accessibility to the multimodal development plan Adams Park and the North Omaha Trail which increases multimodal transportation access. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Quality of Life as an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. As a cultural institution MXMF caters to the culture and values of the thousands of African Americans that make up 50% or more of the demographic residing within the Census Tract and surrounding Census Tracts of our properties. Our educational center provides the classes for community members to learn how to leverage community resources through our  culturally relevant self-reliance curriculum. As the MXMF Master Plan construction improves the physical infrastructure of this particular area in North Omaha which has been underdeveloped, aside from MXMF and neighbors improvements, for over 50 years. The outdoor amphitheater will also provide opportunities for networking and improving the social fabric of the neighborhood. Vending opportunities will increase entrepreneurship in the area and generate revenue in North Omaha. Our proposal directly aligns with and addresses the community's needs.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Along with meeting the needs of the community. MXMF's Master Plan fills in key gaps mentioned in the Visioning Workshop. MXMF's owns vacant lots, in which it maintains. This funding allows MXMF to develop the "vacant" lots to improve the area. The owned lots by MXMF will develop a Retreat Center, which offers temporary housing to visitors, individuals in transitional living situations, and extended group meetings. The Retreat Center addresses the need for exposure to businesses by bringing business talent to the MXMF site. The Outdoor Amphitheater will provide many jobs during its construction, creating opportunities for large corporations to hire within the community providing jobs for individuals in MXMF's Census Tract. With the City of Omaha's Small and Emerging Business requirement, small businesses in North Omaha may also benefit from the large-scale development of MXMF's Master Plan. The opportunity to work on this historic project in the heart of North Omaha fosters pride and encourages community members to stay in the community. Once completed the Outdoor Amphitheater will draw more arts to the area. An easily overlooked gap is the health benefits of a large-scale Outdoor Amphitheater and walking trail. The entertainment provided by the Outdoor Amphitheater will increase multimodal transportation to our destination. Ongoing and sustainable employment will result from the Amphitheater, and other structures in the MXMF Master plan. The Conference, Educational, and Cultural Center of the MXMF Plan is a critical component to lasting change in North Omaha. These Centers will provide the culturally relevant teaching that allow the business, trade, and other education to be relevant in the minds of students who could be traditionally disengaged from education, due to the lack of cultural connection. Culturally relevant teaching is the most overlooked tool in education. Increased tourism that will result from the development of MXMF's Master Plan will also boost the local economy, creating lasting economic growth for North Omaha. MXMF's cultural center will function as a cultural hub and museum essentially boosting community pride.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> MXMF's Master plan is designed to be a world class international tourist destination. The construction of the MXMF Master Plan, ongoing programming, and maintenance will create jobs and provide sustained employment. MXMF's Master Plan has housing in its description and will be pursued for construction in 2024.  Housing constructed by MXMF's contractors will increase options for affordable housing to North Omaha residents. The tourism that will return and increase due to this development is anticipated to be in the 10's of 1000's. This type of tourism will guarantee increased economic activity in North Omaha as well as the rest of the City of Omaha. Those numbers will provide lasting economic growth, and support of small businesses in North Omaha. Fundamentally, MXMF's Master Plan aligns with the guidance of the U.S. Treasury for making necessary improvements to the water, sewage, and broadband infrastructure. Each structure built on the 17+ acres of land that MXMF owns will require such improvements.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> With this proposal we anticipate hiring initially four operational staff to help manage the necessary growth of the organization. This includes a General Manager beginning at a minimum of $60,000; Secondly, we aim to hire a Groundskeeper to assist with upkeep of the property and our community garden efforts at a minimum of $50,000; Additionally we will hire an Events Manager to help streamline and promote rental opportunities with a starting salary of $55,000. Finally we will hire a rental coordinator at $35,000 who will be primary in assisting with the Events Manager with both the existing visitors center in addition to the retreat center. All of these positions will be permanent. The General Manager will report to the Executive Director and the remaining positions will report to the General Manager. 

Other temporary positions will be provided depending on the speed/growth of the development projects as seen fit by the construction managers. These wages should be livable in accordance to state law for the various positions required to include but not limited to: plumbing/sewage; electrical; and other general construction related positions.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Tourism - MXMF Visitors Center receives thousands of visitors annually and is a recommended tourist destination by the Omaha Visitor's Bureau. Pre-pandemic Omaha saw an increase in tourism for 9 years consecutively (VisitOmaha.com 2019). The trend of tourism in Omaha has reconvened post 2021. With more than $8 billion in redevelopment in Omaha, including Kiewit's Luminarium, Mutual of Omaha's new skyscraper, Downtown Streetcar, the North Omaha Economic Recovery Plan, MXMF expects to see a significant increase in tourism to the historic site. In the article titled "Visitation and Visitors Spending is at an All Time High" publish by VisitOmaha.com 2019, it is cited that "Half of every visitor dollar spent in Omaha is spent eating, drinking and shopping.” But the report also states that the largest growth came in the amount of money visitors are spending on recreation, such as going to the zoo, museums, concerts, performances and sporting events." As a response to this newfound research, The Malcolm X Visitors Center, Bed, Breakfast and Retreat Center, plus Outdoor Amphitheater are guaranteed to generate revenue for North Omaha as well as surrounding restaurants & retail businesses.
Outdoor Amphitheater - MXMF's Master Plan includes a small Outdoor Amphitheater. The MXMF Event Plaza has already been host to national recording artists during the Freedomtainment Freedom Festival's of 2021 & 2022. Each event bolstered the attendance of 2000+ people. The Outdoor Amphitheater will improve quality of life for North Omaha residents by providing culturally relevant entertainment and exhibition. The amphitheater will be surrounded by a walkable trail with access to local multimodal transportation through the Adams Park and Bedford street corridor allowing for ease of access and healthy lifestyle promotion. The MXMF community garden and orchard is adjacent to the amphitheater and will address food insecurity within this area, while also further beautifying the landscape. Retreat Center - MXMF is in negotiation to acquire the neighboring property at 3525 Evans Street. This acquisition will fulfill the Bed, Breakfast and Retreat Center designated on the Master Plan. 3525 Evans consists of 19 beds in efficiency style rooms. In the event that the negotiation for the 3525 Evans Street property becomes unavailable. MXMF is prepared to begin new construction to fulfill its vision. Much like Creighton Universities Retreat Center which sleeps 103 persons with room an additional 70 sleeping bags in Griswold, Iowa, MXMF's Master Plan seeks in Griswold, Iowa, MXMF's Master Plan seeks to provide a tranquil place for visitors, organizations, and community members to immerse themselves in a peaceful environment for a enjoyable temporary getaway. The Bed, Breakfast and retreat center will provide 10 beds plus gathering space. This plan meets the needs for improving the overall health and well-being of the Census Tract 59.02 (and surrounding areas), improves the neighborhood infrastructure, creates jobs, and serves as an administrative foundation to MXMF's Master Plan.Site Development/Housing - The current development plans for the historic site also include some housing units which will help improve the quality of life for the neighborhood. Furthermore, it will enhance the perception of North Omaha as being a place worthy of visiting and encourage community stewardship among the residents. Many of North Omaha is designated as blighted due to the historic lack of investment in the area. By making improvements to the site, MXMF can participate in reshaping this narrative in order to provide a more solid foundation for both civic and social engagement in this zip code.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal provides essential improvements for true community sustainability to include sustained tourism through the hosting of local, regional and national events; retreat lodging and housing to the Census Tract in which MXMF's development is located. Additionally, it stimulates traffic and spending in the area improving economic condition and quality of life.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The current Qualified Census Tracts in the Omaha Metro Area does not currently have any small to mid-sized outdoor amphitheaters. The closest concept to this is located in Papillion (SumTur) which is nowhere near the qualified census tracts furthermore emphasizing the need for outdoor space that is accessible to greater Omaha residents. With this kind of space available, its existence is innovative and inspires collaboration among local organizations and cultural institutions.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Tourism is often measured by increased visitor traffic to a location along with the incorporation of feedback surveys. Through this combination of both qualitative and quantitative data, we can easily determine the value and impact received from tourism experiences provided by the historic MXMF site.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Existing staff have the capacity to measure the increase in tourism through onsite surveying and tracking the number of visitors or rentals per month.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> The ability to measure impact due to increased tours and rentals can definitely act as a catalyst for future investment because it will initiate more drivers of business for the neighborhood to include neighboring restaurants, small business and transportation. This may also encourage more collaborations with local universities and colleges to inspire secondary educational training opportunities.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Although no official formal agreements have been made, MXMF is happily willing to partner with other organizations that want to aid in solving the needs of this community. Currently, we have strong alliances with Freedomtainment, University of Nebraska at Omaha, Black Studies Department and International Studies Department; Great Plains Black History Museum; and Opera Omaha; Moving forward, the executive director looks forward to further establishing meaningful partnerships as the organization grows.</p>
