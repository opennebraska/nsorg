  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> We are located at 8315 North 30th St.  Omaha, NE  68112 in downtown Florence.  I would like to be able to open up life coaching and massage therapy to help those in underprivileged communities around the local area and those that could not otherwise afford the care they need.  My idea is allow them some type of voucher program for life coaching services and massage therapy.  This would greatly improve the quality of life living in the north Omaha community.</p>
