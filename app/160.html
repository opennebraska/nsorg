  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Creighton Connect is one of four proposals being submitted by Creighton University. The four innovative and thoughtful projects collectively have the potential to be transformative, lead generational change, and have long-lasting economic growth. 

Creighton University is seeking to develop Creighton Connect, an affordable, workforce housing project to include mixed income apartments and a child development center, to support both current local residents and attract new residents to the area. The project goal is to provide affordable and workforce housing in a location that is accessible to transportation, education, and jobs while offering an on-site extended hour childcare center. The project is in a North Omaha Qualified Census Tract and is the current site of two Creighton educational buildings which are scheduled to close in summer 2023 when programs relocate to alternate campus facilities. 

There is a unique opportunity to redevelop the property to create transformational change in the neighborhood in North Omaha. The vision to blend affordable housing, workforce development and early childhood education/childcare will result in community and resident stability. The housing units would serve an area with critical need with accessibility to various modes of transportation. The project will provide the only extended childcare within a 10-mile radius, offering availability (6:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.) for families working non-traditional workday hours with capacity to care for 100 children concurrently that increases the number of families/children served given the extended hours of operation.

Creighton proposes two supporting programs for the project – financial education and rent subsidies. Rent subsidy funding for income qualified tenants who commit to working as teachers and childcare workers in the North Omaha QCT is being requested. Funding for qualified tenants’ participation in the Financial Success Program through the Financial Hope Collaborative is also being requested. 

Preliminary construction estimates contemplate demolition and a rebuild of the current site. Financial projections will be available in thirty days as we continue to assess cost and housing unit estimates, seeking to achieve the most cost-effective approach to repurpose the site.  Assuming approved funding support by June 2023, the affordable housing development is expected to open in November 2025.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> In line with the funding goals to foster desirable transformation, fundamental change, and long-lasting economic growth in the communities of North and South Omaha, this project directly fulfills the three overarching goals and honors the intentionality of funding priorities. 

Sustainable Community - This project will create an estimated 360 new housing units, specifically designed for mixed income level tenants, with ability to accept rental subsidies. Additionally, the project will create jobs during and after construction using local contractors, and once complete, property management services and child development center positions. Finally, through this project model, careful consideration of cultural design will be implemented to align with North Omaha values and identified points in the Visioning Workshop Summary. 

The operations of the property will be unique in that Creighton University, a non-profit organization founded over 144 years ago, will own and operate the property. As a Jesuit, Catholic institution, Creighton has always focused on community engagement work with a goal of creating better communities and a better world. By integrating affordable housing with access to financial education and an on-premise child development center with expanded hours, Creighton expects to further contribute to bettering the Omaha community, and specifically the North Omaha QCT.  

Parking will be a mix of surface and secure garage parking creating safe access and added security for vehicles and tenants which may include individuals and families with small children navigating access after dark. 

Finally, the project is located across the street from educational programs and community service programs including those offered by the Financial Hope Collaborative, Creighton’s College of Continuing and Professional Education and Creighton’s proposed Innovation and Entrepreneurship Service Center which will provide new individual entrepreneurs, small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community organizations with opportunities to learn and develop a broader understanding of fundamental business and technology practices, more advanced financial technology, as well as provide transactional (non-litigation) experience. 

Multimodal Transportation - The Creighton Connect project is near mass transit, and will have well-lit access points, as well as security. The connectivity through driving, biking, walking or transit to downtown areas is easily accessible through high traffic areas that are patrolled and well-lit.

Existing pathways traverse the property, providing walkability and biking options to residents. The project will include various improvements to walkways surrounding the construction area with intentions to address deficiencies that connect the project to other modes of transportation.

The project is strengthened with proximity to bus stops; the proposed site addresses are located between North 28th and North 30th Streets, and between Burt Street and California Street with 5 bus stops within 2 blocks. The North Freeway/Creighton pedestrian bridge is located one block south of proposed addresses. The pedestrian bridge facilitates a greater connection and improves accessibility between the campus and the neighborhoods on the other side of the busy freeway, a longstanding concern for Creighton University. 

Quality of Life - In addition to providing safe housing, safe childcare, safe working conditions, and safe property, this project will also enhance the existing space through mixed uses (residential and child development center) and the development of green spaces around the buildings. Two playground spaces are planned; one dedicated to the child development center with controlled access to meet modern child development facility requirements and a second to provide recreational amenities for tenants and surrounding neighborhood children.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Innovation happens at the cross-section of diverse perspectives, and diversity in geographic location and individuality is a necessity. This project addresses many of the needs and opportunities identified in the visioning workshops including housing, safety, walkability, and broadband access, while capitalizing on the identified strengths of the area with the powerful sense of community and strong cultural fabric.

This project utilizes identified strengths and opportunities of North Omaha to create a project that goes beyond a simple build. The new development brings energy along the 30th Street,a  focus development area in the overall North Omaha region. Repurposing the property at 28th and Burt Streets ensures the space remains activated in the neighborhood, providing much needed housing density creating an estimated 360 residential units. With proximity to downtown, airport, riverfront, and public transportation, living in this mixed-use housing will be a prime location for students, young families, and those living with restricted means. For non-car households, the walkability and proximity to amenities provided fosters independence for families.

Leveraging resources within the community to execute a strong project plan, project partners are bringing together public and private partnerships in a multi-pronged approach to economic impact. creating community investment, momentum, and support. Partnerships between Creighton University, the Childcare Provider, Personal Finance Programs, Entrepreneurial Center, and on campus programs that are available to the public, a unique blend of resources is directly accessible for clients. With the initial support for the child development center, the project is acting in a small way as a small business development incubator, assisting a new or expanded childcare business. With wraparound resident financial services including tenant subsidized support for employer partners and providing funds to complete personal finance education the project works to impact generational poverty issues and provide models that may not otherwise impact the lives of residents. The project and amenities address community member desires highlighted in the visioning workshop, changing the perception that private funding rarely takes community ownership and input into account. 

North Omaha has a vibrant artist community with talented people, and destination cultural centers. The arts district on 24th and Lake is a strength to the neighborhood. Leveraging that strength, the artwork and décor displayed in the buildings’ public spaces will be works by local artists from North Omaha.

Components of the project directly address the identified gaps and weaknesses identified in the visioning workshop including overall housing challenges and adding mixed-use housing to increase housing density, and retention of young population. As part of the design process, the project will incorporate universal design standards, including the inclusion of accessible units. 

This project also addresses parent challenges with accessing affordable childcare due to nontraditional work schedules by including extended hours and the subsidies for the childcare workers’ rental costs, which were further reinforced in the visioning sessions affecting the North Omaha area. With access to quality care for young children, young professionals will stay in the area to live and work.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The proposal aligns with LB1024’s strategic priorities in multiple areas. The location is in the North Omaha qualified census tract, north of Dodge Street and East of 72nd Street, and provides affordable housing. Additionally, the project meets the identified needs of the visioning workshop and enhances workforce stability, permanency, quality of life and accessibility. Through the Financial Success Program, Creighton will provide financial literacy to improve economic and health outcomes for individuals residing in a qualified census tract.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The project will provide an immediate opportunity for businesses and contractors in the Qualified Census Tract including trades businesses, sign companies, furniture stores, grounds contractors, and other specialized crafts. As part of the contract, the selected general contractor will be asked to commit to award sub-contracts to those businesses located in Omaha, with a preference to businesses located in the Qualified Census Tract.   Additionally, business opportunities will be created for a contracted leasing and property manager and a new child development center. The project will focus on recruiting businesses that are based in North Omaha, while offering wrap-around start-up support to the childcare provider for business operations and to increase capacity.   A draft economic impact study has been prepared using preliminary estimates of construction costs, children served in the child development center, and number of housing units. Based on the estimates, the project will generate 216 jobs for the construction and management of the apartments and 63 jobs for the child development center, totaling 279 jobs.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Leaders speak about having a “culture of innovation” which can be applied to tackling large scale challenges and projects. “Community cannot be engineered. It is a natural by-product of healthy, loving relationships which then foster associations of friendship movements.,” Dave Andrews, author, and community sector leader. Traditional commercial development can seem at odds with this mindset; however, the concept can be used as a philosophy for innovative development projects. Innovative infrastructure projects can be a community builder when the voices of the area are implemented into every stage of the project. North and South Omaha are diverse, entrepreneurial, and proud communities. By creating a sense of “home” Creighton Connect will create a sense of belonging, cultivate relationships through community partnerships, and help to stabilize the neighborhood through additional high-quality housing. 

Mixed income housing has both anticipated and realized benefits, with a goal of alleviating the harms of concentrated poverty and achieving urban revitalization. Evidence supports that neighborhoods and housing quality improves with mixed income units. Additionally, mixed income communities offer low-income households an improved sense of safety and security. Structured programming such as the financial literacy program, child development center, and accessibility to community resources further promotes permanency and livability. 

Improvements in the local neighborhood will continue to bring people together, creating both a strengthened and renewed sense of community. Friendships are made on local playgrounds, parents can set up play dates at safe, easily accessible locations which can create networks of support. The top ways to get to know your neighbors fostering a sense of community, are getting outside, going to local playgrounds, or taking walks around the neighborhood. This project creates natural avenues for residents to get to know each other and develop relationships that will continue to improve the local neighborhood. The project includes the three S’s of creating community connections – Space, Structure, Seeds. 

Economically, the parcel of space that was previously for educational purposes which does not traditionally spur neighborhood growth in terms of space utilization, will be transformed into housing with investments in new and repurposed infrastructure, creation of jobs, and an added industry with the infusion of much needed childcare in the area. The new residential area will create a new pocket of activity, reactivating this corner of the neighborhood and acting as a connecting development, creating linkages to future areas of development to the North and areas to other developed areas to the South including the Atlas Apartments.

The project invests in North Omaha, keeping the connection to downtown strong, developing without displacing businesses or residents, and creating new jobs both during and after the project completion. Additionally, the project addresses the North Omaha threat of the lack of multifamily housing options and although the project provides rental opportunities, not home ownership, it offers a wrap-around approach to retain residents through mixed income housing options, accessibility, and on-site childcare options.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This project contributes to community sustainability by building a safe a healthy place to raise children, access to decent affordable housing, a sense of community and the ability to have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Using local contractors and the addition of two business opportunities (leasing/property management and child development center), as well as rental subsidies for qualified individuals, will create a positive economic impact on the area. On-site programming including financial literacy programming and extended childcare hours will increase quality of life and livability, as well the convenient access to Omaha Public Schools, local stores and employers, and downtown Omaha. 

In a statistical brief published by Childrens HealthWatch, introduced the Subsidized Housing Availability Index and how it is used to understand the relationship between inadequate subsidies and the negative consequences of housing insecurity. A stable, decent, affordable home is an essential foundation for families to thrive. However, this foundation becomes increasingly unsteady when families’ housing becomes unaffordable — defined as paying more than 30 percent of monthly household income for rent or mortgage plus utilities. Addressing households that are overcrowded and households with multiple moves based on accessibility, providing access to quality housing through mixed use properties has a ripple effect on neighborhoods. 

Projects such as the Neighborhoods in Bloom, in Richmond, Virginia revealed that highly focused public and nonprofit community investments resulted in significantly higher property values in these neighborhoods. Even blocks in the target area that had no investment experienced substantial increases in value suggesting a spillover effect in the entire target area. 

Redevelopment and physical improvements spur additional changes. As the gap between development costs and market values shrinks, private investments return to formerly isolated neighborhoods. That is the ripple effect. New and diverse families move in. Existing residents recommit themselves. There is a growing sense of possibility and hope – a shared vision, encompassing downtown development and community revitalization, and cities now offer a better quality of life to more of its citizens. (Ripple Effect, Neighborhoods in Bloom)</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Affordability – By 7/31/2026, the Creighton Connect project will create a mixed income housing development for the North Omaha community with at least 50% of the new housing units serving residents earning 65% to 80% of AMI. This outcome will be measured by Creighton University through construction completion, secured certificate of occupancy, and published rental rates.   Accessibility – By 7/31/2026, Creighton Connect will improve accessibility for residents through proximity to public transportation, promotion of mixed income housing options, and extended hours childcare options. This will be measured by resident surveys and child development center enrollment numbers.   Workforce Development – By 7/31/2026, Creighton Connect will house a child development center which will create new jobs for residents of the building and the larger community. Additionally, the structure of the project will promote workforce stability through affordable and accessible housing options and location. This will be measured by the number of new jobs created and resident surveys.  Economic Impact – Based on the preliminary economic study of the project (see attached for a complete draft of the study), the exponential economic impact of the project can be extrapolated based on the project scope including number of units and overall operations of the child development center. These estimates will fluctuate based on the final completed project, however the impact on the area will be felt well beyond the static project budget.  1.

  <p> </p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Capital funding for a child development center is being requested due to lack of available childcare in the QCT, with limited or no availability for extended care. The center is projected to be 14,000 sf, following all licensing requirements. The preliminary construction cost was determined through a cost estimate which included Creighton University, Field Day Development and a licensed general contractor. 

Capital for housing units was determined based on the funding gap in a preliminary financial model, and closely aligns with the assumption that 50% of the housing units would meet Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelines for rents. The preliminary estimated construction cost was developed through a collaboration between Creighton University, Field Day Development, a licensed architect, and a licensed general contractor. 

Program costs were determined by the per person cost of the financial services program, based on historical data, the number of residents and location of services. 

Program costs for subsidies were determined by the percentage of HUD units, the average wage of childcare workers, and number of anticipated staff working in the center and living in the building.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Program:
$550,000 - Expansion of program operations of the Financial Hope Collaborative. Funds will provide 100 low-income residents with access to their financial success program to be operated from the facility across the street. 

$100,000 - Rent subsidies through July 2026 for residents working in the child development center. 
$200,000 – Grant to fund consulting and other start-up costs for the Licensed Childcare Center 	Operator

Capital:
$10,700,000 – Construction costs for child development center

$36,300,000 – Construction costs for affordable housing units</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The affordable housing construction project is dependent on other funding sources.  Once constructed, the affordable housing units will not be dependent on future funding requests.  However, the ability to provide ongoing subsidies for teachers and childcare staff working in the QCT will be dependent on future funding sources.  It is possible that the child development center operation may be dependent on ongoing funding support. Creighton will own property and facilities. The fiscal operations of the housing units will be managed by Creighton, alongside the leasing and property management partner. The complete financial model is expected to be completed by mid-November.  The child development center will be a stand-alone entity; however, with approval of the childcare program start up grant request, support will be provided in the areas of financial oversight, best practices, marketing and other business-related activities by Creighton and other childhood provider experts in the community.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> At this time, the preliminary financials assume that $15 million of combined TIF and additional grants (CDGB and HOME) will be required to support the proposal. 

Creighton can begin the process of applying for the other funding sources upon completion of the feasibility study and Board approval. 

Yes, based on the preliminary estimates, the proposal will require all funds to continue.</p>
