  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> In February 2022, TLE legally established our non-profit organization, The Legacy Empowerment (TLE), aims to continue aiding our community's future fashion professionals. Our objective is to support them in realizing their vision, exhibiting their work, highlighting their abilities, and honing their craft. In addition, we want to help our community's most vulnerable individuals, such as the disabled and cancer survivors. The organization produces the annual Legacy Fashion Show to enable me to continue working toward our objective. TLE's constant efforts result in them continuing to create equality in society. This proposed project would allow TLE to continue to grow sustainably by acquiring and renovating a specific space and building for the construction of a fashion institute based on the values and ideas of minority BIPOC youth and their mission to tell their own stories and ideas about the history of African fabric. TLE will continue fundraising efforts to start its first programs and services following the launch celebration on 10/14/22, building on the foundation of TLE and what it has achieved for Omaha. In conjunction with LB0124, this suggested proposal would enable TLE to drive efforts to construct a huge sustainable organizational structure that would assist future entrepreneurs and business leaders grow and expand their notions of what it means to create a sustainable fashion profession. The project would be located in South and North Omaha, with a projected completion date of 2026.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> TLE aspires to establish a sustainable community via the variety of its employees, interns, and volunteers. This will occur through capacity building  The organization founded by a black Muslim female entrepreneur, clothing designer, and seamstress. The board president and founder expressly asked a diverse board of leadership that focuses on community "impact changemakers" who would promote thriving communities of color and raise awareness for groups who have yet to be heard. African Americans make up around 8% of Nebraska's population, according to the Omaha Community Foundation. As this group grows in size, visibility, equality, and dialogue will become more important. Fashion that emphasizes ethnic identity, gender identity, and intergenerational dialogue will allow the organization to tackle new subjects. TLE's initiatives include educating the community, volunteering, and fostering a welcome atmosphere for everybody. TLE wants to depict the fashion industry from the viewpoint of underrepresented communities. TLE's goal is to increase capacity, community connectedness, and equal access to cultural knowledge for people of color.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Yes, since it will track the performance and trajectory of people in the North and South Omaha neighborhoods, increasing their knowledge and aptitude for achievement in the sectors of business, finance, and fashion education. </p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Yes, TLE aligns with LB1024’s strategic priorities. This is because TLE will add more value to itself and the work it is doing and plans to do in Omaha as it transitions from a first-year organization to a reputable member of the Omaha nonprofit community by incorporating the ideas of racial equality and social justice into its mission statement, bylaws, and organizational structure. TLE will shift its fundraising approach from one that symbolizes its organizational theory to one that serves as a real-world representation of an organization that can increase racial equality access and community ties for people of color in addition to throwing its inaugural launch party in October. This will be accomplished by bringing in local models to walk the runway during the fashion show, showcasing the eye-catching colors, fabrics, and textiles that are critical to TLE's success. These models will showcase African fashion and hues, as well as education and community participation. DEI fashion concepts align with the inspirations that drive the TLE team and Mourdjana's goal of developing and inspiring an inclusive workplace. Parts of African design, particularly African fashion, based on the country's past promote and advocate social equality.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> TLE will have a large influx of job creation notably in the industry of design and seamstress work via apprenticeships that will be available for students to take during their time with TLE and the staff. Additionally, jobs that will be created during renovation and construction phases of the projects with TLE.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The community benefit is all about advancing and educating persons via fashion and viewing it as a viable profession. The organization was thrilled to be given the opportunity to help people who are just starting out in the fashion business realize their vision, showcase their work, disclose their abilities, and achieve mastery over the skill set required to bring their love for fashion to life. The Legacy Fashion Show's subject of "Diversity in Beauty" served as the basis for the TLE, and the event served as a platform for everyone to host in May 2022. The organization takes great pride in celebrating inclusivity and diversity in the roles of a CEO, Creative Director, and Fashion Designer, Mourdjana Batcha, who is an influential Black female Muslim entrepreneur, especially when it comes to our models, many of whom we have mentored, allowing me to witness their personal development and blossoming sense of self-confidence. Being a female fashion industry leader who is both African and Muslim exhibits creativity and innovation. The Legacy Design Show became an important part of their experience, highlighting the value of mentorship and coaching in the fashion industry.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The concept is based on a solid sustainable model. The textiles and teaching materials are entirely made from recycled resources. Furthermore, it will help those who previously did not perceive fashion as a viable job to recognize the value in its growth. The textiles are constructed and natural environment, and the quality of life is improved via empowerment, which may be taught through education.</p>
