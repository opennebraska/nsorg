  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Chicken Bucket is a catering company that gives every family a way to provide a home-style cooked meal for the whole family to enjoy. If you work, normally you don’t have time to provide meals for your family. That’s where we come in. Every order is prepared with your family in mind. Chicken Bucket offers you choices of whole chicken or two Cornish Hen meals. Each meal is prepared how you like with choices of braised, rotisserie, fried, smoked, and roasted. If you have dietary restrictions let us know. All chicken is prepared to 165 degrees before being sent out to customers. All orders come with sides portioned to your family size. Chicken Bucket offers 32 different sides. Our main protein is chicken. Again, if you have any dietary restrictions feel free to let us know in any and every comment box provided. Chicken Bucket believes we can take care of your family five day a week and give you two days to spend family time.
  
Chicken Bucket is not the average catering company. We believe in giving back to the neighborhood that helps us obtain our goals. We plan on saving 3.5 percent of yearly profits for the first three years. Once our goal is reached, we plan on giving the saved profit to rent relief for the customers. Everyone that joins the Chicken Bucket group will be eligible to be put in the drawing. The Chicken Bucket is a family-owned business that offers more than great tasting food, we also offer relief.
    
The goal is to be in the Leavenworth area to be able to serve both North and South Omaha, by 2023.</p>
