  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Heartland News is seeking funds to build and provide a line of sidewalks of stars, 
containing the names of people both living and deceased that heave made contributions that made a difference in the world.  These individual will either have been born and raised in Omaha around in other parts of Nebraska.  The project will educate the public on prominent men and women from Nebraska. The project's aim is to offer a way the public will have access to view honorary recipients for their contributions and accomplishments.  A fund in the amount of $400,000.00 is necessary to kick-off this project.

The project will start off at the sidewalk on the southwest corner of 24th and Lake in North Omaha, and overtime, it will end at the the northwest corner of 24th and Cummings Street.  It will be an ongoing project, issuing 4 stars a year.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Planning and preparation will start on November 1, 2022.  Construction to construct the sidewalks would beginning on around May 15, 2023.  The laying of the first star would be June 10, 2023.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Too many prominent individuals from Omaha has made different contributions and/or accomplishments throughout the nation, but has yet to receive a Star of recognition in Hollywood or any other type or recognition elsewhere.  Or there are individuals from Omaha that have received recognition in other arts of the nation, but are still not recognized or known for their accomplishments in Omaha.

To address the problem, The HEartland News plan to buil and conduct a walk-of-Fame in Omaha that will recognize our hometown heroes for their achievements and contributions to the world.  The proposed project will offer encouragement to the youth, as well as the adults, as it educate the public about the individual being honored with a star at an open ceremony.</p>
