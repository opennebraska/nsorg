  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Since 2017, Shift Omaha has tracked the following statistics:
	40+ graduates
	Over 60% of graduates return and serve for Shift
	85% of graduates say they are more confident as entrepreneurs
	In 2021, Shift graduates generated $17,000 between each other (keeping money in North O)

Shift Omaha offers monthly business workshops, networking groups, financial services, business coaching, and coworking space. These services intend to build up entrepreneurs in North Omaha at affordable rates directed toward inner city business owners.

Abide is a non-profit organization dedicated to eliminating inner cities. Abide began in 1989 and focuses on a strategy of building safer neighborhoods, growing stronger families, and developing emerging leaders. Their vision is that there would be no place in Omaha, NE defined by “redlines” or “red dots”. In the Omaha areas where Abide has helped establish a lighthouse (houses in North Omaha where a family lives and works with those around them to love the neighborhood and people in it ¬— see Abide.org for more info), crime dropped an average of 75%. Abide also operates a food bank serving the local area.</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 150000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Inner cities are facing unprecedented challenges. Cycles of poverty and crime ravage the lives of the next generation. That’s why Own The Pond launched an inner-city entrepreneurship program called Shift: a 16-week entrepreneurship incubator designed to train, mentor, and resource people to shift into an innovative mindset. They envision thousands of inner-city entrepreneurs who were once a part of the problem and are now a part of the solution by launching and scaling successful and viable businesses. Every inner-city industrialist deserves to be successful and in control of their future. The 16-week incubator is designed to empower leaders by exposing them to tactical thinking while immersing them in experiences that will enable the students to develop creativity, critical thinking, effective problem solving, communication, teamwork, and other entrepreneurial skills that will enable them to succeed in future ventures. Own The Pond believes consultancy is essential to the process, so they provide group mentoring opportunities. Creating space where seasoned business leaders can pour into the next generation of leaders is paramount to their success. In addition, every graduate who completes the program is provided a Chromebook, a micro grant, access to the networking circle, and world-class business coaching. The money from the LB10204 grant would be used to renovate and furnish a space on the Abide Better Together campus (3223 North 45th Street, Omaha, NE 68104) for them to expand their classes and mentor more entrepreneurs in North Omaha. The renovation would include upgrades/repairs to the HVAC system, new lighting, new flooring, wall repair, painting of walls, window treatment, and furniture. The grant will not be used to start a new program with a hope of success; it would be used to expand a proven program with a history of success so that it can reach more people. Training and mentoring increases wealth in the community and reduces crime. The group is positioned to start the renovation immediately upon award of the grant.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Renovation of the space can begin immediately. The space will need some design support for equipment repairs, however, much of the work can begin immediately. Completion is anticipated by Summer of 2023.</p>

  <p> 0.99</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Shift Omaha is an organization dedicated to training, mentoring, and resourcing people to shift into an entrepreneurial mindset. The vision is that by encouraging and supporting entrepreneurs in the North Omaha area, new businesses will be started, wealth will be built in North Omaha, and the new owners will support others to do the same. When people who live and work in the area have a vested interest in the success of the community, they will be more likely to support the local community and avoid crime. There is a shift in cleanliness and community in areas with local ownership and a decrease in poverty and crime. As stated by the founder of Own The Pond (Myron Pierce) “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a life, but show him how to own the pond and he’ll build a legacy that outlives him for generations to come.” The goal of Shift Omaha is not to reach a single person, but to have generational impact to help break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness. The grant would be used to finish and upgrade the office and training space. With the completed area, Shift Omaha can serve more people and expand their reach. They will be able to provide an affordable coworking room with the technology available to start the new entrepreneurs off in a competitive and supportive position. When owners are trained, supported, and respected, they are more likely to succeed past the initial opening. Success is not just starting companies, but ensuring they have the assistance and resources to last and empower future generations.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Some of the weaknesses listed in the SWOT analysis from the Public Engagement Summary for North Omaha include:
	Economic investment does not recycle within the community.
	Financial literacy and access.
	Lack of connected businesses economically.
	Lack of investment.
	Lack of black owned companies that attract others from outside the community.
	Lack of responsibility for community conditions and economic resources.
	Lack of jobs.
	Lack of for-profit business.
Shift Omaha focuses on supporting residents to start businesses that benefit the local economy. Most of these entrepreneurs are black. These for-profit businesses create for jobs and recycle the money within the community while also drawing in residents from other communities to spend money.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024 Section 4(2) states that the grant money shall be distributed with an emphasis on “assistance for small businesses, job training, and business development within such communities and neighborhoods.” Shift Omaha is an organization focusing on helping residents in North Omaha to start business. They provide the training and business development assistance to help initiate small businesses.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The grant money from LB1024 would not directly create business beyond the construction cost to local contractors. The largest benefit is that the money would allow Shift Omaha to train others so that they can create businesses. The money is not a one-time benefit to a select group of people; it is the seed that allows a wide reach empowering others to create jobs. In the last five years, over 40 people have graduated from this program. These are people who create a domino effect on others to help create jobs, recycle investment, and support local growth.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> The program run from this space will be to create jobs.  This is a jobs creation program so the only limit is number of people enrolling and time.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Construction will use existing North Omaha companies or individuals.  The number of jobs created temporarily for construction is unknown.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Unknown as the program is to create business owndership.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> This job creation program targets North Omaha and the QCTs identified.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Jobs are a benefit to a community. Those jobs take on additional significance to the people creating them or working there that believe in the cause. When someone starts a business, they typically try to clean up the area and prevent troubles from occurring on their property. As the business grows, they try to support other local businesses. This trend leads to a closer community and reduced crime. Shift Omaha empowers people to start or grow their businesses in the community. This mindset leads to generational change. Kids mature with strong supporting parents and a family business to take over. There is less hopelessness and more unity. Shift Omaha is aiming to alter the trajectory of North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> When residents have ownership in their companies, they are invested to make sure the company succeeds.  This includes keeping the area clean and staying out of crime.  This also leads to families staying together and kids being raised in family environments.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> This plan incorporates both proven practices and innovation. Larger successful businesses already attend conferences, share information, and incorporate partnerships. Shift Omaha is bringing these same opportunities to local small businesses at a scale more suited to their needs. Co-location office spaces are also popular for many companies. This type of space allows small businesses to start and grow at a lower cost than owning a building. Unfortunately, these co-lo spaces are often still expensive for new small businesses. It is not uncommon to pay over $2,000 a month for 300sf of office space. This cost is cost prohibitive for a small business. The combination of cost effective co-lo space and the training to be successful incorporates known best practices at a scale and cost to benefit local small businesses. Another innovation is the ongoing support for the businesses. Many seminars are set up for a fee with impact that concludes with the end of the conference. Shift Omaha stays in contact with graduates and helps them in an ongoing process. From providing computers to financial training, Shift Omaha sets new businesses on a successful path rather than speaking to them and immediately ushering them out the door to succeed or fail on their own.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Shift Omaha measures multiple metrics including the number of graduates, revenue generated, percentage of graduates who return to serve for Shift Omaha, and percentage of graduates who feel more confident as entrepreneurs. These metrics look at the income, but also the engagement of the graduates in the program and their commitment to the community. When a person feels confident and assists others, they are more likely to succeed long term. When people are trained and engaged, they are more likely to help others. The measurements tracked intend to look for the success factors of a small community business.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> These outcomes are measured and tracked through surveys and ongoing follow-ups with Shift Omaha.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, when business are created there is always room for additional investment to grow or multiply.  In addition, the owners themselves have been seen to invest time and money back into Shift Omaha and helping other businesses grow.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Shift Omaha is run by Own The Pond. In addition, the Founder of Own The Pond is the lead pastor at Mission Church in Omaha (3401 Patrick Ave). This relationship creates an inherent partnership. Moreover, Christ Community Church also partners with Mission Church and Shift Omaha. Abide is another significant partner with Shift Omaha. Abide owns the space and is leasing it to Shift Omaha at a greatly reduced rate as this program aligns with the strategy and goals of Abide.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> The partnership with Abide is formalized. The partnership with Mission Church is due to common leadership. The partnership with Christ Community Church is a long-term union advertised on their website, in services, and through service projects.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The budget for the renovation is as follows:
	HVAC repairs/upgrades: $30,000
	Lighting upgrades: $20,000
	Electrical / communication upgrades: $20,000
	Flooring upgrades: $20,000

The budget for renovation and furnishings comes to a total of $150,000. We are requesting $100,000 with an anticipation of fundraising to cover any cost that exceeds $100,000.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The grant will be used to fund the renovation of the space on the Better Together campus of Abide for Shift Omaha. This includes design cost, building infrastructure repairs/upgrades (mechanical, electrical, and telecommunication upgrades), cosmetic upgrades (carpet, paint, etc.), and furnishings (desks, chairs, computers, etc.).</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Shift Omaha is financially sustainable. During the initial startup phase, funding was acquired through local churches and private donations; the program itself is now sustainable. Funding will be used to complete a space to meet/train and donations are collected to sponsor community members to attend the training. Donations and sponsorships are collected to help those who would not otherwise be able to attend the training, however, the attendance fees are intended to cover the cost of the program making it sustainable long term without additional grant funding. Additional funding later would only be necessary if the program were to expand to multiple locations add co-lo office spaces in the community.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Shift Omaha has not applied for any other grants or funding at this time.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Without this funding, Shift Omaha will continue to operate and will slowly renovate the space over time.  The renovation may be scaled back and the speed at which people can be trained will be slowed, but the program will continue.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> This program is scalable throughout North and South Omaha. The request for funding is based upon a single renovation and is not scalable. Any shortfall in funding would require changes in the design or space renovated.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Shift Omaha is proposing providing $50,000 for this renovation. This will be accomplished though church fundraising, local business support, or time/resource donations. Shift Omaha is a successful organization in Omaha and committed to continuing in Omaha. Omaha is their home, and they are 100% dedicated to providing jobs, hope, and a positive lasting legacy in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
