  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> SAVE wants to build up the quality of life in these communities for our students and future students to come. By providing support throughout their academic life, they are more likely to graduate from high school and in return become more successful community members. Not only does SAVE support the students within the classroom but also outside the classroom with extracurricular activities. SAVE provides our students with financial assistance for any extracurricular activity they want to participate in. Whether it be in sports, arts, or anything else, our students are learning key developmental skills when they participate in extracurriculars. Participating in any team-like activity has been proven to help develop skills such as leadership, time management, communication skills, self-confidence and so much more. SAVE strives to level the playing field for our students and open opportunities to become thriving individuals within their communities.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Visioning Workshop Summary aligns with our proposal considering SAVE’s programming serves students from the outlined areas: North and South Omaha. The findings of this workshop express needs for infrastructure, development that fits within the cultural context, and access to tools to leverage community resources. This proposal seeks to focus on the positive development of the members that live in these communities so that they are enabled with the tools needed to build and develop their community. Rather than being an outside entity coming in and providing these needs, SAVE seeks to work from the inside out and put focus where it really matters: the youth living in these neighborhoods.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal aligns with the strategic priorities of LB1024 considering participants have a higher ability to bring housing needs, assistance for small businesses, job training, and business development to their communities and neighborhoods. As outlined in LB1024, SAVE focuses on the community development of these areas through education and opportunities. As stated above, this proposal puts emphasis on those living within these communities to enable them to develop their neighborhoods in relevant and informed ways.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal contributes to community sustainability by improving quality of life for the youth living in the neighborhood.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> SAVE Follow Through Program will bring a new concept to Omaha by providing support to local students such as academic help, financial assistance for school and extracurricular needs, and social-emotional development. From the wake of COVID, students need more and more support with all aspects of life. SAVE wants to ensure these students don’t fall through the cracks and instead lift them up to be successful in their future. Will bring opportunities to not currently available for North Omaha residents</p>
