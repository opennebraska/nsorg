  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> THE SITE IS CURRENTLY A VACANT CITY BLOCK.  THERE ARE NO STRUCTURES TO DEMOLISH NOR ANYONE TO DISPLACE.  SOME UTILITY LINES WILL NEED TO BE RELOCATED AND A VARIANCE ON ZONING NEEDS TO HAPPEN.  WE HAVE HAD A PRE-APP MEETING WITH THE CITY REGARDING THIS PROJECT AND THERE WAS NO RESISTANCE TO THE PROPOSED VARIANCE. The proposed project would include development of the site with a three story, 36-unit multiple family residential building with a 48 stall surface parking lot on the western portion of the site and a 12-unit townhouse development on the eastern portion of the site.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project will return a vacant block to housing opportunities for individuals and families located within or near several Qualified Census Tracts in North Omaha. The addition of 36 units of multi-family residential units will fill the housing gap that continues to be a need in northeast Omaha. The diversity of housing type on this site will increase the social capital within the neighborhood and the diversity of family type. Furthermore, this site is strategically located between the North Omaha Trail and the proposed Belt Line Trail, which provides access for vehicle-less tenants. The demand for additional housing opportunities in North Omaha has been expressed though the Forever North Study and the North Omaha Development Plan. 
The proposal expands the number of black owned companies that will attract additional investment in North Omaha and supports recent quality development in proximity to the project site area.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> his project meets several opportunities and needs identified in the Visioning Workshop for North Omaha. Alignment areas include leveraging vacant parcels, community ownership, replenishing aging inventory, and investments in workforce housing stock.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project aligns with several priorities identified within LB1024 for  North Omaha, including:
-	Responding to deepened existing disparities resulting from the disproportional effects of COVID-19 within low- and moderate-income and minority communities
-	Targeting resources within Qualified Census tracts geographically situated in North and South Omaha
-	Emphasis on targeting a portion of resources toward housing needs and wealth-building among minority populations effected by historical practices such as redlining</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We anticipate permanent jobs to be created with respect to the management and Maintenace of the new proposed structure.  In addition, we anticipate hundreds of temporary jobs to be created through the course of construction by various contractors and sub contractors working to build the project.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> We would pay competitive wages for the industry standard.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> t is a priority of this project to hire contractors located within the communities where these duplexes will be constructed. Specifically, when building in North Omaha, we will seek North Omaha-based contractors.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The direct community benefit of this project will be threefold. First, the project will produce 36 units at approachable rates Second, the proposal increases livability by locating in a walkable community and third, it provides housing opportunities for students enrolled at Metropolitan Community College</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> In addition to the benefits listed above, this project will address the need for leveraging vacant properties, as identified in the Visioning Workshops. Revitalizing vacant properties results in increased tax basis for communities, stronger property values for neighboring homes, neighborhood beautification in the removal of unkempt lots, and oftentimes reduced crime activity
Furthermore, investments in housing are correlated with increases in regional economic growth, as well as an increase in overall community health and well-being. As noted in the Affordable Housing Study:
- $8 million in local income and 122 jobs are generated from every 100 units of affordable housing.
- Families in affordable housing are able to spend five times more on healthcare, 30% more on quality food, and two times more on retirement savings.</p>
