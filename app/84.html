  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal helps cater to the 55 and older community, specifically helping service lower income residents.  It will help create transformational opportunities within the community as senior single residents occupying larger homes now have access to lower maintenance housing, which in turn creates more housing for younger families to backfill the currently under-utilized single family housing.  Additionally, this site is located on a metro area transit bus line which provides effective transportation for our senior residents.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We are providing new construction housing made available to lower income senior households. Specifically located on a bus line.</p>
