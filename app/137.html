  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Novella Senior Living will be taking a vacated nursing home located at 4809 Redman Avenue in Omaha and repurposing it to new independent senior living apartments.  It will be one building consisting of rehabbing the existing nursing home as well as a three-story addition for a total of 160 units on just over 5 acres.  The new building will have 134,424 finished square feet.

It will have a mix of 40 studios, 114 one beds and 6 two beds all at 60% AMI. All units will come with refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, access to laundry and storm shelter. There will be a large community room with many other common areas for the residents to utilize plus three elevators. The owners will be providing all residents utilities with the rents plus free wi‐fi. This creating a very efficient and streamlined experience for the residents of Novella.  

The market study shows strong demand for affordable senior housing. This location has great visibility and its proximity to services including a bus stop will be very beneficial to residents.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal helps cater to the 55 and older community, specifically helping service lower income residents.  It will help create transformational opportunities within the community as senior single residents occupying larger homes now have access to lower maintenance housing, which in turn creates more housing for younger families to backfill the currently under-utilized single family housing.  Additionally, this site is located on a metro area transit bus line which provides effective transportation for our senior residents.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We are providing new construction housing made available to lower income senior households. Specifically located on a bus line.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024 places an emphasis on housing needs, assistance for small businesses, and business development within communities in Omaha's qualified census tracts.  

Our proposal provides much needed housing to senior residents in a QCT area while also providing short-term and long-term job creation for the area.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Temporary - 60 jobs over a 24 month time period at $33/hour
Permanent - 25 jobs at $25-$28/hour</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We will be prioritizing small business partners and contractors within qualified census tracts to build long term relationships. This will create temporary and permanent jobs to further increase economic development and wealth creation within the community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Taking unused, vacant nursing home and it’s additional unutilized land and turning it into a productive asset in the form of livable housing that brings a vibrant new look to the area.  This will provide additional tax revenue as well as 160 residential dwellings.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Our proposal will contribute to community sustainability by being able to leverage the existing streets, sewers, & infrastructure to fully utilize the implementation of infill housing.  Also able to further drive participation in metro area transit by being located directly next to the bus line.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> We plan to incorporate the best proven practices by building quality, energy efficient housing.  This will include solar, which makes our project more environmentally sustainable.  Innovative water collection for the ability to use recyclable water for community garden.</p>

  <p> We work heavily with the VA and the HUD/VASH programs in providing for safe and secure housing for a vulnerable population.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> These outcomes are measured by our staff and our productivity within the community.</p>
