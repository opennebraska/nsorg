  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> “We can’t simply say ‘Shop Locally!’ and keep our economy vibrant and healthy”. “We have to take the time and spend the money to support local businesses with our presence and our dollars. You really do vote with your wallet, and shopping locally casts your vote for your City. Local business closures have skyrocketed due to covid 19 forcing 60% of small businesses to close permanently. 
Transporter Inc uses multimodal transportation to provide first and last-mile delivery services for local businesses. Local businesses will be able to list their goods and services for sale through the Transporter Inc app and website. Transporter uses local drivers to pick up and delivers goods from local businesses. Transporter Inc's mission is to provide local businesses an opportunity to compete with national companies like Walmart and Amazon.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Omaha’s extensive and aging infrastructure bifurcates the community which is a barrier to connecting small businesses and customers together while maintaining the quality of life for North Omaha residents and business owners.

North Omaha has several no-car households and needs multimodal transportation for increased community connectivity resources to foster less car-dependent neighborhoods.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Reach new customers, increase profits and grow your businesses. Transporter offers curbside pickup and delivery services that empower small and local businesses. Transporter brings small and local businesses together on one convenient and easy-to-use platform to sell their goods and services.

Restaurants, Grocery, Clothing, Delivery, Pharmacy, Convenience, Appliances, Electronics, Home services, etc.

North Omaha business lack community cohesiveness and consensus. Small businesses feel the need to take their piece of the pie instead of working together making it hard for customers to support local businesses. This leads to the following:
 • Lack of thriving black businesses
 • Lack of black-owned companies that attract others from outside the community 
 •Lack of for-profit businesses
 • Lack of connected businesses both spatially and economically
 • Lack of healthy restaurants or stores 
 • Lack of commercial and retail businesses 
 • Lack of jobs 
 •  Failing infrastructure 
 • Public transportation only goes so far. Public transit doesn’t meet the needs of the current population.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Transporter Inc plans to create 50 full-time jobs and 200 part-time jobs paying $19.80 and up. Jobs will be made up of drivers and customer service reps to support the sales and delivery of goods and services sold by local businesses.</p>

  <p> 1. More of your money will be kept in your local economy For every $100 you spend at locally owned businesses, $68 will stay in the community.

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Transport has been recognized as a means to overcome local disadvantages and gain access to better jobs, education, facilities, and services.
inadequate transportation can also increase social isolation and can increase the risk of early mortality, depression, and dementia. Lack of transportation limits opportunities and bars resources. It systematically creates and perpetuates inequality forcing individuals to depend on costly car ownership. Reliable transportation is the single strongest factor in the odds of escaping poverty</p>
