  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> We are requesting start-up capital. Our goal is to purchase 4 undervalued properties in the North Omaha Qualified Census Tract, remodel and retain them as long-term investments for individuals within the community. Preferably historic structures in the North Omaha area. Properties will be acquired from various sources such as the city’s tear down list and Omaha Land Bank. These four properties will be rehabilitated and used to support the community’s need for housing as well as building wealth within. 50% of the project will be dedicated to affordable housing candidates. Those individuals will have the opportunity to go through our educational program to learn the benefits and importance of owning and maintaining a home. Our mission is to guide our renter through the real estate cycle of not only renting, but owning. Our desire is to stick with them through each stage of the process. From renting to owning and ultimately using the property as equity to fund their first investment properties. This to create generational wealth and financial freedom by empowering and educating them with prosperous investment solutions. This project will be the first of many in an effort to build better families, communities and businesses while keeping local land and houses IN the community. In an effort to build better businesses we are looking to hire within. Each piece of the project will be completed by a member of the North Omaha community. This includes all construction work, licensed contractors, as well as any other work or services needed to complete the project successfully. The timeline for this project will be as follows: All properties will be acquired and restored by the end of 2025. This will allow us about 6-9 months to acquire the properties, leaving us with a year to restore them all. We anticipate another 30 days to place the chosen candidates into their new homes. We will take applications during the restoration process to ensure that we have given the time needed to make the best choice possible. Upon Project success we look to complete our first 60 unit senior living project(2025).</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Properties to be acquired by the end of first quarter 2023.
We are currently vetting licensed contractors and local construction companies within the North Omaha area. We will have each contractor submit their bids for the project and choose from the top three. 
Each property will take about 6 months to complete from start to finish.
During this 6 month period we will be collecting applications from rental candidates. 
We anticipate that the project will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter 2025 so that we can have our renters in their new homes by first quarter 2026.</p>
