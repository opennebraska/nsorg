  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Distributed Resources Group’s goal is to assist businesses in building a sustainable competitive advantage through collaboration, drive new revenue, quicken time‐to‐market, and increase innovation. 
Distributed Resources Group (DRG) provides business to business system services and development support, allowing organizations to focus on delivering faster value to meet their organizational requirements.  
Just lowering operational cost is not the key motivation behind our outsourcing services, as organizations are expecting service providers to inject agility and innovation into their business operation.  DRG provides innovation by enabling organizations to buy a module of service that can be effectively procured and integrated for required time periods, then safely removed from the environment when its useful life has expired.
“Value, rather than cost, is the new watchword, and will likely be measured by how service providers help empower business growth through innovation,” says outsourcing survey.
Over 15% of today’s organizations have between $100,000 to $1 billion in annual revenues.</p>
