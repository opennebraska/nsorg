  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The North and South Omaha communities noted concern for health and wellness access in the needs assessments. This proposal allows for inclusive and accessible use of a space that will contribute to their wellbeing. The mobile yoga studio will help create a sustainable community by providing accessible space to address mental and physical healthcare. This proposal is a sustainable alterative to brick and mortar spaces that are restrictive and don't accommodate all member of the community. This proposal addresses the quality of life concerns of residents by providing a safe space to practice selfcare and wellbeing. With issues like obesity and poor physical health this proposal creates an accessible space of wellness. This proposal also creates a space to provide safe shelter from outside elements as participants enjoy the benefits of yoga.</p>

In North Omaha residents were concerned about Public health being poor, with many households and individuals struggling with obesity, cancer, and other diseases. Yoga movement can address these concerns. The mobile yoga studio will add to the culture of neighborhoods by presenting a space for families to use that is nearby to their homes.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This request responds to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative impacts on public health. The effects of covid linger on for members of this community and this proposal will allow them to improve their wellness through the use of the mobile yoga studio.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> This proposal creates up to 15 new jobs in the community from staff, to contractors, to construction work remodeling the mobile studio. Working with black owned construction companies like Blair Freeman to do remodeling work on the trailer will be a major part of this proposal. This proposal will create 3 full time positions for community members. The 5-7 contractor positions of instructors could translate into full time employment.</p>
