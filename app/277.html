  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The Bryant Resource Center, Inc. (BRC) is a 501c3 nonprofit led by St. Benedict The Moor Catholic Church, whose 150+ year old legacy proudly stands as the first Catholic church in Omaha to serve Black parishioners and one of only 800 Black parishes out of 21,000 in the United States. 

Located in the North Omaha historic 24th and Lake neighborhood, at  2417 Grant Street, (qualified census tract 43#, zoned R7, zip 68111), the BRC is a 3-story building (8,962 square feet) and sits on .36 acres in the heart of the redevelopment area at 24th & Lake and was the central hub for the community.  In 1966 the church closed its school when the Omaha Public School system began desegregating education.  The school building transitioned into the community center and became its own nonprofit (1985) serving the community by leasing classroom space to local small businesses, providing recreational activities on the outdoor basketball court, and being a place for assembly to improve the socioeconomic development and well-being of the community in North Omaha.  The Resource Center is named in honor of long-time community icon George Bryant, who led the Dan Des Dunes band for more than 20 years.  (NorthOmahaHistory.com)

Noteworthy completed projects and accomplishments include:

2020 - building stayed open during the heart of COVID-19 connecting people to the church’s food bank, the daycare and providing Internet connection to those needing broadband access and using outdoor basketball courts.  Volunteers provided communication COVID-19 updates and dispersed PPP supplies.  

2013 - received Scrub Bubbles grant from Queen Latifah’s Foundation to clean the outdoor basketball court and add a scoreboard.

1973 - The City of Omaha Parks & Recreation Department recommended the center be acquired as a civic community center.  The neighborhood rallied together, retaining ownership for their beloved building.

Provided Technology access and training for older adults and those without access to broadband and tech devices.

Hosted recreation events (inside and outdoors) to include basketball camps and contests

Every Sunday, dinner is served to anyone in the community for free.  Due to proximity, a loyal homeless and low income population enjoys this regular fellowship and access to balanced meals in an area deemed as a food desert.

Prior tenants included Labor Unions, Construction Firms, Suppliers, Business Professionals, Religious Groups; however due to the state of the building today, there is only 1 tenant (daycare which provides year-round services from birth to 12 years of age)

Prior townhall site to connect to community advocates, political candidates and elected representatives.

Hosted the North Omaha Black History Museum until it moved to its present location.

Condors Drill Team Drum Corp. used the facility for practice and training engagements (Financial Literacy, Getting Hired, Keeping A Job).  They have been temporarily moved to the basement of the church building due to the BRC’s renovation needs.

Hosted annual religious youth programming including Zawadi, African Heritage youth leadership training focusing on learning gifts from God. 

Assembly center, providing for small to large group gatherings, was open for general community meetings at no charge.

Community go-to center for many national and local celebrities that “grew up” using and volunteering for the Bryant Resource Center:  Businessman Alvin Goodwin, Cattleman and Entrepreneur Herbert Rhodes, the Nebraska State Senator Ernie Chambers; actor John Beasley; and Theresa  Glass-Union, the mother of actress Gabrielle Union. Preston Love, North Omaha Advocate and historian, Businesswoman Cathy Hughes, and native sports stars, including Baseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, football player Johnny Rodgers, Football Hall of Famer, Chicago Bears Gale Sayers, Houston Texans starting running back Ahman Green,  unified Super lightweight and current WBO welterweight Champion Terence</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> In the last 5 years, the BRC building has been able to operate minimally due to a major water leakage precipitated by its aging structure (roof, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, commercial kitchen).  The pandemic delayed rehabilitation planning and fundraising which has multiplied the impact and now due to increased costs; will require more financial resources to fix correctly. The BRC A.M.E.S. Project is a 2-phase plan to renovate and revitalize the space, returning it to the prior community landmark; where, once concluded, will offer educational, cultural, recreational and economic opportunities to improve the well-being and vocational capabilities of North Omaha. 

Location:
The BRC is located at 2417 Grant Street in the heart of North Omaha, Nebraska (census tract #11, zoned R7) in the identified redevelopment zone on 24th street.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Phase 1:  Upon award approval, Blair Freeman, a black women owned contractor business from North Omaha will create a punch list of renovation needs with itemized budget for Board approval.  Based upon early conversations with construction experts (Alley Poyner Macchietto architect, area builder) and comparable research of other successful community rehabilitation projects (Nebraska City’s Veterans Memorial Building), this cost is anticipated at $15 million and can be 100% accomplished by mid 2024 (14 month period) after receipt of funding (June 2023).  The building will remain open during renovation, and allow community access in phases as projects are completed.  It is planned to host a public dedication during Native Omaha Days, Summer 2025.

Phase 2:  The building will partially remain open offering the present services (daycare, outdoor recreation, Sunday dinners) during the course of renovation.  Upon award approval and as the building in sections is rehabilitated for public use, the Board will reinstate / expand its programming and services to include:  family resources, workforce development resources, small business/technical planning and training, tenant space (small business, nonprofits, elected officials), computer lab, conference/class rooms, arts/music programming, coffee shop/mini cafeteria, commercial kitchen.  A strategic consultant will assist with planning and grant management. Cost to support is $2 million and will be 100% expensed by July 2026.</p>
