  <p> 619379.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Will provide the following formal cleaning education certifications by the Worldwide Cleaning Association: Custodial Technician Training Basic, Advance and the Global Bio-risk Advisory Council Training (Enhanced Pandemic Cleaning). Webinar on demand to learn about Green Cleaning Initiative.

In addition, I will have formal training on advance cleaning equipment that are very expensive. These equipment increase productivity and decrease labor cost. It is difficult for new cleaning contractor to gain access to technological advance cleaning supplies and equipment. i want to make it available for individuals in the qualified census track areas to train with these technologies and have them available to use.

The location has not been secured. I will look for a building in north or south Omaha in a area required.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> I have the ability to teach certification now through Zoom and at community classrooms. The training with the actual equipment and the rental store to have everything full functioning would take an additional 3 months after securing a building to lease.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> COVID-19 Pandemic caught the world and Omaha unprepared. Our world is changing.  When it comes to cleanliness we are facing new challenges every day. The coronavirus is not our only infectious disease threat. There are hospital acquired infections that don't respond to antibiotics ,and there is the green cleaning movement which advocate safer cleaning solutions to help improve indoor air quality and to reduce the amount of cleaning chemicals released in the environment. Those chemicals among other things contribute to climate which has become a big. problem. We all have to make changes and I believe that happens most effectively through education. The key to success is the knowledge of existing standards, current regulations and the implementation of Best Cleaning Practices for preventative disinfection protocol shared by the Worldwide cleaning Industry Association (ISSA) and the Center for Disease Control. This is why I think formal cleaning education is so important to bring to the affected communities.What</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> I've struggled for 8 years operating a construction cleaning business in North Omaha.
Although there were many community programs geared to help minority construction contractors my business didn't thrive. I needed a mentor. You don't know what you don't know, and when I needed to ask questions I didn't have a mentor in my field of work that I could talk with. My biggest problem was bidding and estimating. I didn't need someone to do it for me I just needed to be taught a consistent system to follow.

These cleaning certifications and the ability to see and use these new innovative cleaning equipment will help small cleaning business owners clean faster and more efficiently. I want to build an entrepreneurial platform for cleaners to seek training to support their business which will allow them to collaborate on large projects together if so desire. They will be comfortable with each others quality of work and in addition have access to superior cleaning equipment. From my experience right now there is a lack of mentorship, lack of access to education, and a lack of equipment available for rental in these qualify census tract North and South Omaha Communities. My program will change these lack of conditions.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The LB1024's strategic priorities aligns with Economic Recovery Act provides funding to help North and South Omaha whom were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 PANDEMIC. My program supports the strategic priorities by offering standardize cleaning education and training in a that currently have a large demand to fill cleaning position. Not only can this program provide untrained entry level candidates high quality cleaning education to prepare for a potential job, but it provide great training and resources for cleaning entrepreneur just getting started. 

Lb1024 requires that the funds be allocated to identify federally qualified census tracts in Omaha. This program will serve the individuals in those areas with the intention to reduce unemployment, reduce poverty and to increase generation well.

My cleaning company is family operated. My son learns with me and one day he will run this business. The cleaning industry is a multi-billion dollar business. It is a great trade for producing generation wealth and this program is designed to embrace learning both formally and by experience.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> More people will enter the cleaning field with training openly available in the community. I believe there will be an increase both in temporary and permanent job acceptance. Training produces confidence. Cleaning wages different depending on the type of cleaning scope. General office cleaning could range between $12.00 - $15.00 dollars and hour. Whereas construction cleaning range between $18.00 0 $22.00 per hour.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Network with general contracts I have previous done business with. Also, I would make sure they are signed up with City of Omaha Tier 1 and Tier 2.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> I believe that the program will allow works from North and South Omaha to collaborate on large cleaning projects.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Much of the equipment that has been chosen for this program and what will be taught in the certification classes cause minimum negative impact on the natural environmentally. In addition, small cleaning business and employees of companies may set themselves apart from their competitors and open doors to lucrative contracts and opportunities from federal contracting officer whom require green cleaning programs. My program will teach the fundamentals of designing a green cleaning program. Many private companies also have green cleaning requirements under the LEED certifications.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> With formal cleaning education being more widely available it should elevated the awareness of green cleaning programs and the importance of the programs to reduce poor indoor air quality in both our schools, office buildings and our homes.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> I would like to see an increase in interest in applying for cleaning jobs in the Omaha community. So of theses position are great jobs with good benefits.</p>
