  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Dream Center, located on 2201 N 24th Street, Omaha, NE,  will exist to bring the needs, wants, and resources to the community of North Omaha in efforts to restore it to a place where it is thriving and its residents are proud. The focus of The Dream Center is to be immersed within the community in need, in order to identify its needs directly from the source. The Dream Center believes that this has been the missing component to many of the countless efforts that have gone into North Omaha.The culture of The Dream Center will mirror that of a living, breathing, robust ecosystem. This curated ecosystem will evolve through the catalyst of The Dream Center and will serve community members interested in developing their personal, professional, and leadership skills by providing space for the development to take place, be consistently developed, and sustained.
