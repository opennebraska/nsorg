  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Technology- and Media-Enhanced Experiences Program, or TAMEE Program, was first created (in principle) by Charles “cp3o” Parks, III in June, 2008.  Mr. Parks taught a Tech- and Media-based, Out-of-School Time (OST) curriculum for Creighton University’s Upward Bound Program.  Over 50 students participated in a variety of activities based on an incentive-driven curriculum designed for disadvantaged college-bound high school students.  The prize for that particular year was a new laptop computer.

Points were given to students based upon their participation of activities both in- and out-of-classroom.  Mr. Parks created a website showing the leaderboard for all of the participating students.  As a result, the session had 100% class participation, not only because the curriculum was relevant and of interest to the students, but also because no student wanted to be at the bottom of the leaderboard.

Since its inaugural debut, TAMEE has served hundreds of middle and high school students (many of whom are on Free and Reduced Lunch) and given away thousands of dollars in prizes and incentives throughout the Omaha, Nebraska area.

If selected as a funding recipient for the North Omaha Recovery Plan, the TAMEE Project could be expanded to offer greater impact and positive outcomes to those who reside and work in North Omaha.  Not only would middle and high school students continue to participate in some of the best STEAM courses offered in the city, but adults, seniors, and professionals would also be able to participate in a variety of activities that build their own Tech and Media skills.  These are skills that are necessary to navigate today’s digital society, and gives professionals a much-needed edge to be employed / contracted in today’s Technology and Media careers.

    • Renovation / conversion of a Service Station into a Multi-Use Facility
    • Purchase of a Mobile Fleet (1 Classroom, 2 SUVs)
    • Creation of an Online Tech- and Media-based LMS (Learning Management System)

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The most significant cost for this program is for personnel. Including operational costs, this ensures that TAMEE programming will be consistently provided at least for four years.

Based upon previous TAMEE participation, the incentives will increase participation from residents and business owners / employees. The financial support will defray burdens that would otherwise hinder the ability for participants to successfully utilize TAMEE's offerings.

The equipment will allow the simultaneous participation of at least 60 participants of TAMEE Classroom curriculum per class hour.

The FUSE renovation converts an old, unoccupied service station into a safe, multi-purpose facility.

The STEAM Mobile Classroom allows TAMEE Classroom activities to be conducted on any premises that can support parking of a Recreational Vehicle. This could be for sites that do not have adequate or available classrooms.

The Mobile SUVs will allow for the safe transportation of TAMEE personnel and equipment to Classroom sites. The Mobile SUVs could also be used to safely transport TAMEE participants to / from the FUSE location or other relevant partner locations, if scheduling allows. Devices can be plugged into the rear-seat monitors for additional visual productivity (e.g. review lesson plans). These Mobile SUVs also intentionally provide additional comfort to reduce pain attributed from constantly loading and unloading hundreds of pounds of equipment each week.</p>
