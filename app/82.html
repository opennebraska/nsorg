We understand the challenges that minority and more specifically Black owned businesses face. We have faced them in the past and continue to face time in the present.  But we know how to overcome and impart that knowledge to other businesses.  Over the years, the firm has received recognition from numerous organizations for its business success, as well as its contributions to the community. Annually, the Midlands Business Journal has annually recognized Hayes & Associates as one of the region’s most successful CPA firms. In 2009, Frank Hayes, our President, and Managing Shareholder, was inducted into the Omaha Chamber’s Business Hall of Fame in part due to a recognition of the firm's long tradition of involvement in the Omaha community. We mirror the community that the funds will support. Over the years, Hayes & Associates has provided significant support to the community in various forms, including support for youth programs, housing for low and moderate-income individuals, disease prevention and cure, and employment programs through Hayes Cares, a nonprofit managed by Hayes staff. Each year, staff members serve on the boards of, and volunteer with, various not-for-profit organizations. We reflect the communities we serve with our staff and with our approach.

  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Part A of this proposal is for the Financial Education, Counseling, Consulting and wrap around services and the expansion of our office and service area. We understand that financial literacy and education is the key to success for communities which have traditionally been disproportionately impacted by the Covid 19, affordable housing, rising inflation, tax burdens, quality health care, and challenged career/ work opportunities. We plan to have an office in Lincoln which will allow the community of North Omaha to work with State officials for procurement of state contracts, competitive subcontracts, and receive hands on assistance with our Lincoln office. This will also allow Hayes to secure more partnership opportunities and increase the number of jobs available to perform the work. In addition, we propose to partner with the Omaha Public Schools system to provide financial literacy classes/ training, teach or have a club that educates students on the financial services industry and specifically train them on bookkeeping. The bookkeepers will then be paired up with small businesses in the community, to assist them with day-to-day bookkeeping task under our supervision. We will partner with MentorPlus services to assist with student training and engage other financial professionals within the community that mirror the community. In additions, this proposal is for an expansion of services that we already offer directly to our clients or via a collaborative arrangement with Omaha 100, an existing nonprofit corporation. We will administer and deliver the financial consulting and counseling wrap around services in coordination with Omaha 100 on behalf of Sankofa Economic Development IHUB to assist the IHUB with its goal of creating and developing strong new entrepreneurs and existing businesses that can scale, leading to sustained economic growth for Omaha and more particularly the North and South Omaha communities. The services will include: an initial assessment of the businesses’ needs; an initial consultation to set expectations; provide general training and seminars around financial education; a preliminary plan to execute that may be modified throughout the service delivery process as circumstances warrant; face to face, email, and written communication on best business practices; periodic (at least monthly) training seminars on various business and personal financial topics; ongoing counseling/coaching; and specific financial management services available for client’s success will be as follows and customized and priced to client’s business needs specifically to include financial readiness required for capital acquisition. tax compliance and business plan execution; business development services or client acquisition services with federal and state government. These services will be provided from our Omaha location or Lincoln location or from the IHUB operated by Sankofa Economic Development Corporation. Services are ongoing as the client needs arise. The Grant Expenditure Review, Part B of this proposal, will be an important requirement in maintaining compliance and accountability  by supporting a series of financial reviews with the grantees.  The review will confirm that projects are proceeding as planned and there are no financial irregularities.  In the event there are concerns raised as a result, the review will allow corrective actions to minimize the risk of misuse of ARPA funds.  These reviews will also help grantees identify ways to strengthen their capacity and operations.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> See comments above under around alignment. As noted in LB 1024, the social and economic challenges in North and South Omaha have persisted for multiple generations, partially fueled by past racial segregation and the historical practice of redlining. These and other practices have caused distrust in the communities. Having a well-regarded and trustworthy partner (Hayes & Associates) perform this review can create enduring trust in the legislative process and in key the decision makers. 
From our inception, Hayes & Associates has been a strong community partner. Our values include excellent service, approaching our work with a passion to understand, appreciate and exceed client expectations by providing SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic & Timely) solutions, community engagement, employing a diverse team of professionals actively engaged in the areas where we live and work, expertise bringing thought leadership to what we do, diversity and inclusion, being committed to being culturally rich, inclusive and diverse in our service areas, client base, and with our team members. Our work will be infused with these values and the residents in the community and small businesses we come into contact with will feel it. Long lasting economic growth spurred by profitable, successful businesses will occur.

We believe a financially well-educated community empowers the community to continue to invest and grow within the community and is a catalyst for influencing financial dreams to experienced realities. 

We also believe in collaboration, hence our relationships with other community members such as Omaha 100 and Sankofa as we deliver these services. We believe in empowerment, partnering with our clients and team members by equipping them with the tools and resources that foster development, innovation, and positive growth.</p>

This will create an unpredictable number of new jobs and the creation of new businesses. Businesses will be able to scale each year with a double digit increase in the number of employees with high paying jobs.

  <p> These outcomes can be measured by the number of healthy, financially sound, well run businesses that are providing jobs in the community as compared to those that are now.  It can be measured by determining the wages that are being paid by these companies as compared to today.  It can be measured by a review of the revenues that are generated by these business as compare to similar businesses in the Omaha area.  The funded IHUB will have the resources to monitor and gauge the success of these outcomes. Other organizations such in the community also has these resources.</p>

  <p> The request is based on the Visioning Plan and needs of the community.
