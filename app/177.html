  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> THE HUB is a proposed small business hub and training center serving covid-impacted and disadvantaged individuals and businesses; specifically supporting and training subcontractors, construction trades, consultants, makers, artists, and self-employed people to grow their businesses and create jobs.

Using the successful model of the Hot Shops THE HUB proposes to redevelop 1920 Dorcas into at least 100 separate rental bays used by member subcontractors, businesses, makers, and artists. Bays will range from 100-5,000 SF +/- with flexibility to upsize or downsize space. There is ample parking and outdoor storage space. 

THE HUB will provide: 
-	Administrative support (mail & logistical support, bookkeeping, operations support, social media support, graphic design).
-	Industrial Training Center 
-	Tools and equipment to loan/rent: trailers, ladders, scaffolding, lift, concrete tools, metalworking and woodworking tools, welders, stone and tile tools, 3-D printer, plan plotters and printers, and more.
-	Staging space
-	Wood and metal workshops 
-	Flex storage inside 
-	Meeting rooms
-	Photo/video/audio studio
-	Printing and shipping center
-	Breakroom
-	Gallery to sell member’s wares
-	Mentoring
-	Estimating Services
-	Advertising and promotion
-	Monthly breakfast networking and training events.  
-	One-on-one business coaching and mentoring.
-	On site U-haul truck rental service
-	COMMUNITY. 

THE HUB has partnered with Reconnect Success Inc to provide construction job training. Unions and private companies can use the training facility to aid in recruiting and training workers for new construction jobs. Those trained can then be hired by companies in THE HUB, or by private companies we partner with such as McCarthy & Weitz. 

The Hub Gallery supports job creation and will sell wares of HUB members. 

THE HUB will be an ongoing source of new jobs, projected to be a minimum of 350 new jobs within the 5-year program period, and operational within 18 months of the grant allocation. Job creation will be tracked through the Training Center attendees, and annual reporting required by businesses operating out of the shops and/or offices of the HUB.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Hub Business and Training Center Project addresses community needs by providing modern industrial, commercial, and office space for South Omaha’s entrepreneurs to locate, operate, and grow their businesses from. It transforms and underutilized industrial asset and will help support economic growth and spur redevelopment in South Omaha. Moving small businesses from garages and yards to The Hub improves the aesthetic and the community’s overall quality of life.  It’s not just about real estate, The Hub will provide members that want it full logistical, administrative, bookkeeping, marketing, image,  and social media support, as well as secure outdoor storage, staging space, flex storage space, a printing and shipping center, tools and equipment, and fully equipped woodworking metal working shops.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Because of a lack of modern commercial and industrial buildings serving small businesses many of these business owners make do and try to run their businesses from their garage, yard, or storage shed. This will strongly impact and diversify the South Omaha economy by allowing existing small businesses the room to grow their business, increase revenues and quality of life, and hire more staff, while improving their home neighborhoods by not operating shops and construction companies from their garages and overstuffed yards. The site is an underutilized industrial building and yard closely located to South Omaha’s strong workforce and entrepreneurs. Using the successful model of the Hot Shops, the Applicant seeks to improve the site and transform what was an underutilized facility into a beautiful, modern business hub and training center providing opportunity for South Omaha entrepreneurs to move from their garages and yards into space that will accelerate their revenue and employment growth. South Omaha has a long history of a strong work force and hard-working business owners. This project also supports investment in the community by creating desperately needed affordable commercial and industrial space and outside storage for South Omaha small businesses to operate and grow, creates at least 3 new Latina owned business to start, an Industrial Training Center, plus over 350 projected jobs over the Program Period.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Hub Business & Training Center transforms and fundamentally change an underutilized industrial building and site. Due to the high demand and scarcity of commercial and industrial space in South Omaha the Project will be sustainable and will create long-lasting economic growth by supporting the businesses that will be members of The Hub. The Project will transform, fundamentally change, and have long-lasting economic impact in the lives of the 250 Industrial Training Center participants we expect to train over the 5-year program.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> What is the anticipated job creation and wages associated with your proposal (temporary and permanent)?   create 60 temporary jobs, 350 permanent jobs, 250 of them coming from graduates of the Industrial Training Program.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 350</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 60</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Of the 350 jobs created, 342 are in the construction trades which are high-paying in demand jobs. Of the other 8 jobs created, the pay ranges from $35,000/year to $70,000/year.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Our bilingual staff will actively work to connect graduates from our Jobs Training Program with members who might need to hire new employees. We've established partnerships with McCarthy Building Group and Weitz Construction to refer training program graduates to them for hire, and to let our members know about bidding opportunities with them. We will maintain subscriptions to all plan rooms and bid boards in the Metro and notify our members or bidding opportunities. We will partner with many non-profits in all QCTs to recruit candidates for the job training program, and to connect our members with projects and new business.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Project will not only transform an underutilized industrial property, it will transform and fundamentally change the trajectories of the covid-impacted small businesses from QCTs that will benefit from the facilities, programs, and amenities of the HUB. The Hub is located across the street from Lynch Park, and users of the park and surrounding neighbors will benefit from the improvements and use of the Project site. The surround QCTs will be positively impacted from the vibrancy this Project will create in the economy and business activity in South Omaha and the Near Downtown neighborhoods which are QCTs.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This Project will ignite the spark of business growth for covid-impacted South Omaha businesses operating from inadequate or substandard space, causing significant economic impact and sustainability in South Omaha from the 60 temporary and 350 new jobs this Project creates and the increased business revenues this Project supports. This Project will provide sustainable services and economic impact in an underserved and depressed area highly impacted from covid.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Omaha lacks a modern business and training center serving small businesses and small contractors with cutting edge amenities and support that usually only big companies can afford. The co-warehousing concept, and tool sharing concepts, are used nationally but relatively new to Omaha, and should have dynamic reception and impact for the members of the Hub.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Improved job training, increased revenues of members, and creation of new high-wage jobs.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> We could measure the high-wage job opportunities with required annual reporting from our members documenting their new hires with their 941 reports and tax returns, and Reconnect Inc can document and track jobs created for their Training Program graduates.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> An improvement of this magnitude is bound to build momentum and create additional redevelopment in the surrounding neighborhood. Graduates of our training program could eventually open their own businesses, hiring more employees. We expect our member businesses will be able to expand their businesses and reinvest in their businesses based on the increased revenues our Project will create for them.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Reconnect Inc. will be our job training partner; RISE! and Compassion in Action Inc. have committed to refer program participants for the job training, and/or to be members of The HUB. Once launched we will seek to partner with the Salvation Army, Stephen Center, Goodwill Industries, Teen Challenge, Boys & Girls Clubs, area High Schools, Metro Community College, and other groups to help recruit job training candidates and/or small businesses to be members of the HUB.</p>
