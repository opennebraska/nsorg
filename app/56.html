  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The projects contained in Attachment A: Consolidated Q Street Corridor Economic Recovery Partnership Application address all five of the community needs identified through LB1024 to support economic recovery and community vitality. This multifaceted array of projects in a concentrated geographic area will maximize the impact of Recovery Act funding. Examples of projects supporting each identified community need include: 

Sustainable Community:  

Revitalizing vacant community landmarks 

Offering home equity loans to low-income homeowners for home repairs and investments 

Renovating aging affordable housing stock 

Increasing education and recreation opportunities for girls 

Expanding child care and after school and summer care that allows parents to work 

Expanding access to behavioral health services 

Developing the healthcare workforce 

Supporting emerging entrepreneurs  

Multimodal Transportation:  

Investments to turn Q Street into a vibrant, flourishing, commercial district that is accessible to drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists  

Other Infrastructure:  

Expanding broadband and free, public Wi-Fi to neighborhoods that have suffered from the digital divide 

Quality of Life:  

Recreational indoor and outdoor space for youth and adults  

Planting trees along a busy urban thoroughfare  

Policy:  

Context-sensitive, culturally and linguistically relevant programming and services for youth and adults 

Investing in community members’ leadership and as systems change agents 

Other:  

Workforce development and job creation and supporting educational attainment through GED courses and English classes 

Not only does the Economic Recovery Act support collaboration among nonprofits and between nonprofits and the public sector, it also provides an opportunity to leverage the assets and talents of private sector partners who share a commitment to prosperity and economic opportunity. For example, with LB1024 funding, Midwest Maintenance Realty, LLC will develop mixed use buildings along Q Street through its "Q Metro" initiative. Midwest Maintenance CEO Jaimie Gutierrez participated in planning calls with the Q Street Collaborative partners and, while the Q Metro application was submitted separately due to the timing of preparing the collaborative application, the nonprofit partners in this Q Street Corridor partnership are excited about its plans to accelerate economic growth, create jobs, and  support entrepreneurs and small businesses, thereby enhancing the neighborhood and contributing to our shared vision for Q Street.</p>

Projects address lack of infrastructure through broad scale investments in both the built environment (roads and buildings) and the digital infrastructure of broadband and Wi-Fi.  The partner organizations are well positioned to support development that fits within the cultural context of this community, and projects will provide residents with tools to leverage community resources in support of economic recovery and community vitality.
