  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Project HerSOmaha - is a mixture of Real Estate Development with culture &  enrichment to the community, South Omaha area. I plan on bringing color, culture, and housing in an area where it's greatly in need.  The community benefits from adding 5 projects varying from 18-24 units each. All in the census qualified track area, four other locations to be determined. These Infill projects will create housing much needed for locals,  where they feel itâ€™s home. Each apartment will be about 900 -1000 square ft, this will provide a more spacious environment in the apartments; something that is lacking in the South Omaha housing. These apartments include two bedrooms, two baths with a laundry room setup included. The idea of the tenant, empty nesters,  young couples getting started, two roommates, or even a small family of 1 or two kids. The location is right on 39th and L street - near a bus line on 42nd and L street within walking distance. Less than 5 minutes of drive time to the interstate and 24th street for all major shopping needed. Hitchcock park is also less than a 5 minute driving distance. The economic impact will be major as I plan on using local subcontractors, around 22 different trades that live in the area that would create jobs and provide an opportunity for the hispanic construction talent to shine.
This package will be  Transformational to the area.  It will fuel the area with culture & attraction for locals and outsiders to come and see a little of Mexico in South Omaha.  Ultimately drive folks to come and see South Omaha and the shopping district where many can support the local economy by eating at a restaurant, buying goods, or come and visit and see what we are all about. This too is a way to give back to the community, this is where I grew up.   This is the area my kids want to continue to be a part of and prosper..  It will inspire young entrepreneurs to get active and be able to provide for our growing and beautiful South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> As soon as funds are secured the first of 5 projects can be launched Spring of 2023.  18 unit mix at 3905 & 3911 L Street, Omaha NE 68107.  I would also secure the 4 other locations immediately that would be needed for the project.  The second one would be launched in Spring of 2024.  Third one would be launched Spring 2025 and the last one Fall of 2025.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 0.9</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> Provide additional housing in area which is greatly needed, specially for rent.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The project will provide additional housing for about 100 families with the five projects that will be added in the South Omaha area.  These will be new, modern and with a touch of cutture to blend in with hispanic community.   These are apartments that people can be called home and will bring a quality of life that they deserve in their area of interest.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Provide housing for rent which is greatly needed in the South Omaha area.   This too will provide an affordable place for families to live in and a place they can feel is like home.   My 5 projects will be able to provide them exactly what they need without the cost of buying a home and having to worry about repairs which many don't understand or are aware of.  I will take that burden away but still provide the place they need to be called a home.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The goal of the QCT Recovery Grant Program is to foster 
desirable transformation, the project  will be transformational as we haven't seen anything similar anywhere around. It will bring a great deal of pride to the local community and residents in the area.  Fundamental change to be epic!  Create an example of how much we need our labor force because they are the best and how much they are providing to the economy locally!</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The project will provide stronger economic recovery as it will bring work that will be filled by the local trades within the community as we know there is a strong construction workforce in the South Omaha area.  These jobs will be provided at a critical point where many builders are beginning to stop construction work due to high labor, high interest rates and high material costs.  The creation of jobs includes potentially hiring 20 different trades means that there can be 20 small businesses that will add to the local economy.  These will be temporary jobs but with the opportunity to hire them 5 more times should be the first project be replicated 4 more times.  
Those trades include in no particular order 
SECURITY SYSTEM
ELECTRICAL
FLOORING
HVAC
PLUMBING
FOUNDATIONS & FOOTINGS
DRYWALL
MASONRY
CONCRETE
ROOFING
KITCHEN COUNTERTOPS
CERAMIC
TILE
PANTING

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> I plan on using mostly local trades within the community for all construction related, landscaping and cleaning services.  If each total project cost is about 3.3mm 90% would be able to stay within the local community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Long-lasting economic growth in the community of  South Omaha. My goal is to make the construction labor standout more so now than ever.  Educating everyone of the great potential we have in the South Omaha area and how rich we are by providing to the labor force and skill workers that make a difference in our communities with their labor, hard work, and pride in what they do.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Creation of work in construction in the South Omaha area, housing, better environement in new buildings, overall a better quality of life for the area and the tenants.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> There is currently no other projects similar in Omaha area.  This is a complete new concept with the outside look of the vibrant colors.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> It will improve by creating more apartments accesible to the community.  Overall assisting with the shortage of rentals in the area.</p>

  <h3>GeneralContractorPublicCompetitiveBidWhyNot</h3>
  <p> It was not needed</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> High construction labor costs countered by explosive housing demand  & rental demand.

High material costs are still lingering  while wood has somewhat stabilize its still higher than usual.

High interest rates currently at 7% make it difficult to have this project be viable unless there is financial assistance.</p>

  <p> The funds will be used strictly with an estimate of the contruction cost, fully expecting those numbers to increase as the projects continue.</p>
