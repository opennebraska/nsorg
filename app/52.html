  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Kids Can is on track to complete construction of our new community center at 4768 Q Street by December 2022.  The new 27,000 SF building will double our space and include two (2) infant rooms for ages 6-weeks to 18-months, four (4) toddler/preschool classrooms for ages 18-months to 5-years old, three (3) classrooms for elementary students age 5 to 13-years old; plus a gymnasium with full court and spectator space, cafeteria, outdoors play-spaces, expanded offices, workrooms, meeting areas, and community room for neighborhood meetings and training sessions.

All our programs will double in capacity and we will be hiring 25 full-time equivalent employees to accommodate this increase.  With the new center and other program expansions, we will be able to benefit more than 1,400 students a year.

Kids Can, formerly known as Social Settlement Association, has been an organizational mainstay of the South Omaha community for 115 years. We look forward to continuing to be a support for our families for many generations to come.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Kids Can Community Center has an organizational history in Omaha for 115 years. Established in 1908 as Social Settlement Association of Omaha, we rebranded to Kids Can Community Center in 2009 to better reflect our vision and programs.  

We are nearing the completion of a new facility that will double our capacity. We would like to take this opportunity to further serve our community with additional outdoor recreational space for our families and community partners to learn, play and compete.

Our proposal is to build an athletic field at our new community center site at 4768 Q Street in Omaha.  This would be the only community field in the historic Social Settlement neighborhood of South Omaha.  In addition to being fully used during weekdays (for up to 250 children), it would also be available for evenings and weekends for community partners. The field would be able to support both child and adult sports programming.

The proposed space would utilize an artificial turf field for easier maintenance, lighting for early evening events, and accessible restrooms during usage hours. Visitors will also have an adjacent parking lot at our center with an ample amount of stalls.

This is the only available space for a field in our surrounding neighborhoods. If built, this would be the only athletic field within a 1.5 mile radius and would complement the offerings at the nearby Hitchcock Park that encompasses baseball, swimming, and skating activities.

This funding comes at a pivotal point in our second century of service to South Omaha.  With a new community center to open in 2023 that will double our capacity, this field will greatly improve our overall capabilities to benefit our students, their families, and our beloved South Omaha community that we are proud to have been a part of for 115 years.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Kids Can has pre-emptively created a leveled space for a future field on our property at the corner of 46th Avenue and Q Streets. Our ideal timeline would be to begin ground and sub-surface preparation in Spring 2024, followed by field installation in Summer 2024.  Simultaneously, we would put in other amenities (lights, electricity, restrooms) as determined by the construction schedule. Barring any labor or supply chain issues, the field could be ready for use by Fall 2024. If there are potential labor or supply chain issues, this timeline could be shifted to early 2025.</p>

There simply canâ€™t be enough safe, recreational space in South Omaha, and we want to take advantage of the land that we have and this opportunity.</p>
