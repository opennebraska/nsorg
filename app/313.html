  <p> Service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The proposal is a continuation of my current work of mentoring and teaching multimedia  (photography, videography, design, marketing) to youth and all who are interested within the North and South communities. This would be through having facilities and tools available for the interested to manifest new work and Sharpen their creative talent.  With a program and facility, not only can we grow and nurture local talent, but also we can create multimedia jobs that we wouldnâ€™t have to outsource. It would be a great way to retain local talent.</p>

  <p> If this can be done in conjunction with a program that is already being done like the Innovation Hub, I believe this can be completed by 2026</p>
