  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Location - 1821 North 30th St (30th & Parker).  The building will have 4 floors - floor 1 will be commercial space which will provide the community with much needed opportunities for more food options, laundromat services, convenient store, or potential various other types of businesses.  Floors 2-4 will be residential apartments/condos comprising of 36 much needed rental units.

Currently, this property is vacant ground with only a slab of concrete where semi trailers are parked.  This new building would create a much more attractive presence for the community but would also create job opportunities from the commercial space and provide 36 brand new housing units for the community.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> The construction timeline and overall design of the building is currently being developed by B2lab Inc, an Omaha based architectural firm.  We anticipate to have the floor designs and construction timeline finished within the next 30-60 days.  Once the design is complete, a general contractor will be hired with hopes of construction starting in May of 2023 with an estimated 12-18 month construction timeline.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The proposal would create 36 brand new housing units for the community while also enhancing the appearance of the area.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The proposal aligns with several findings mentioned in the visioning workshop summary.  This proposal will increase economic activity with the potential of adding several businesses within the 1st floor.  Ketaw Bereded has already discussed the opportunity with other fellow North Omaha business owners who are excited for the finished building.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Economic development opportunities will be created for by the 1st floor commercial space.  Also, the residential aspect of this proposal will help to fulfill a need of more quality housing in North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The anticipated businesses who rent the commercial space will likely each need several employees to operate.  Speculatively, this could potentially create several dozen full-time equivalent jobs in the area.  Wages for these jobs will depend on the type of businesses which rent the space but would ideally be good paying jobs helping to provide for North Omaha families.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> It will depend on the type of businesses that occupy the commercial space - potentially 10-30</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Several - the build will require various different specialty contractors to erect a brand new building</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> This will depend on the type of businesses that occupy the commercial units</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The commercial untis will always have a need for employees as long as the space is occupied.  Ongoing jobs will be needed in these businesses</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Economy diversification will be provided by this proposal by increasing the number of opportunities North Omaha business owners have with the creation of commercial space.  This new building will improve the neighborhood in a multitude of ways, some of these are (but are not limited to) - providing much needed residential units, creating a better appearance with a brand new attractive building, and creating new job opportunities.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Sustainability will also be created in multiple ways by this project.  Economic improvement/opportunities will be created by the commercial space.  Quality of life will be improved for the area residents by the new businesses who occupy the commercial space.  For instance, if a Subway rents part of the building it will create more food opportunities or if a laundromat rents part of the building it will provide for needed services.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> There are many buildings similar to this in Omaha which have thrived and made its community more attractive.  We hope this new building does the same</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Creating new opportunities for other North Omaha business owners, help keep money in North Omaha by creating new business opportunities, create very attractive living opportunities that so many in the area are seeking</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Vacancy loss - if vacancy is very low then it will imply that the rental units were in fact much needed</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes absolutely - if this building can prosper, Ketaw Bereded would be inclined to join forces with other area business owners to construct more buildings similar liek this in North Omaha</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Construction costs have been increasing at an exception rate lately.  The amount requested will help to make this investment more appealing.  The current construction cost levels make this investment a very risky proposition.  This funding would greatly influence the ability to make this a viable project</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The grant funds will be used to help with construction costs which are currently at a historic high</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Capital contributions by the sole owner of Noamin LLC - up to $1,500,000

Bank financing - up to $4,000,000

Potential grants applied for - up to $700,000 ($500k from this application)</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> City of Omaha grant - potentially $10,000, NDOR grant - potentially $200,000</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> The $500,000 will offset high construction costs.  If construction costs are too high after bids are received, this proposal may not be feasible without the LB1024 funding</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> No - this proposal must be 100% completed in order to obtain a certificate of occupancy</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Noamin LLC is prepared to inject up to $1,500,000 of capital into this project and will assume many more millions in bank financing.  If this application is approved, it will provide for a much greater chance of this proposal occurring which will benefit North Omaha greatly!!</p>
