  <p> Goal #1: Grow Revenue

Growing TJCC revenue is the top goal. Increasing my client list and diversify my service package.

A.	Get more leads.
Devising a system that brings leads to TJCC organically as well as, creating marketing and sales funnels that drive leads into my business. 
•	Facebook ads and Facebook Marketplace
•	Instagram
•	Mailers
•	Email marketing
•	Networking events
•	Google Reviews
•	BBB Rating
B. Grow current market share.

As a small business owner, I am always focusing on ways to get a bigger piece of the pie and maintain my current customer base, maintain stellar customer service, and continue to grow. Some important factors I look at are:
What are my competitors doing to get more leads?
Why do customers choose them over TJCC?
And some research to see what’s setting my competition apart without copying them. I us the information to assess areas where my business may need to improve, whether its stepping up my marketing or getting better reviews.

C. Expand into additional markets.
The forward goal is to expand into offering services to hospitals, Airport Services, Events and Public transportation in the greater Omaha and surrounding areas. To be able to setup re mote teams in (if needed) to be responsible for servicing that area.  

Goal #2: Quality Customer Service 

I believe that my reputation should precede my business reputation, so if I want TJCC to be known as the best cleaning business in town, I have to earn that reputation.

And I can be done with...
1.	Better Hires
2.	Better service assessments.
3.	Better incentives for my clients and employees.

I developed a monitoring system that monitors the quality of work provided by the team. A review system for customers to provide feedback/survey of services rendered.

I use a Service Form to gather feedback from clients after a service is complete and factor in their feedback to evaluate and/or improve services. This will also show how an employee (or team) is performing. The Service Forms will be reviewed and based of review score; staff/teams will be rewarded for their good work by a compensation plan that revolves around quality survey scores.


Goal #3:  Community Involvement

 A janitorial business doesn't exist in a vacuum. From the local region where it operates to the industry it belongs to, a company is part of larger community. Finding ways to give back to and get involved with the community is critical for any business.

TJCC Community involvement will support employee volunteerism.  And also hopes to be able to give back going forward by sponsoring scholarships to lower income students, in efforts to further foster a sense of unity.
Here are some of ideas to foster community involvement:

•Host a donation drive:  Bring donations to local charitable organization on behalf of TJCC. such as, Homeless shelters, food banks, Senior Citizens advocacy and Youth programs to name a few.

Also by partnering with other organizations to clean up the neighborhood in need of clean up, and disaster help and assist the elderly who do not have the resources to get help to keep their living  space safe (clean), 

•Make TJCC Community Involvement Efforts Public: Make public by social media platforms, emails and business blogs

And when possible, attach a dollar amount to TJCC donations so that our customers can clearly see how much TJCC gives to the community. Because getting involved in the community goes a long way toward highlighting my company's values, creating goodwill with your clients, and can attracting and retaining talent. I feel that successful businesses have a responsibility to contribute to their community. Not only is it the noble and right thing to do, it's also a sound business investment.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Business Overview - Tate Janitorial Commercial Cleaning service is located in Omaha, NE and was became an LLC in April 2016. And currently has 3 employees, 2 cleaning technicians and myself (owner) performing all other roles such as marketing, back up cleaning technician. Our current target markets are primarily professional offices and schools with cleanable office space of 10,000 square feet minimum.

Marketing– TJCC uses Account Based Marketing, what this means is weighting our budget to best payoffs. The strategy is to shift our resources to the biggest payoff and not market to every business equally. TJCC’s marketing plan will focus 80% of our effort to 20% of our leads (our Key Accounts) in efforts to reap 80% of the rewards.

Management– As TJCC grows as a diverse commercial cleaning service, where it’s common for businesses to have 10, 20 and even hundreds of employees. I want TJCC to stay boutique with goals to hire 2 additional cleaning technicians (one full-time and one part-time) to allow me to focus on marketing.

Financial– The financial part is the final part of the business plan to map out a long term success.  TJCC figures our costs for a job and then add our gross margin. Our gross margin goals will are as follows:

•Specialty cleaning jobs including carpet, tile, furniture and VCT- gross profit- 70%
•Small cleaning jobs less than $10k per year- 60% profit
•Medium jobs- $10k – $30k per year – 50% profit
•Large Jobs- $30k plus- 40% profit

The reason is smaller jobs require much more office support, staff supervision, training, supplies, etc. Larger jobs are self-contained on site location typically provides some of the cleaning supplies.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> By November 1, 2022  - Start screening/hiring process to hire on 2 additional Cleaning Techs (one full time and one part-time) as resources to support and sustain the current spike in business.

By December 1, 2022 - Have  all employees fully trained in position, and cross trained for other locations (buildings), and in other areas diverse services (i.e. Lawn, moving and disaster clean-up) that TJCC offers

By March 2023 - And all staff will be fully versed and trained in current client locations cleaning processes and policy, solidly positioning TJCC with reliable and fully trained professional Cleaning Techs, and be better positioned to bid and great chance of winning large clients such as Parks and Recreation, OPS, hospitals, hotels and retail long term cleaning bids before 1Q2023.</p>
