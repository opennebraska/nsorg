  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Goodwill Industries, Inc.’s (Goodwill Omaha) mission is to change lives and strengthen communities through education, training, and work.  Goodwill is committed to providing equitable access to workforce development solutions across our community. 

Goodwill Omaha will open a 16,000-square-foot training facility and 10,000-square-foot retail store in Southeast Omaha, at 3505 L Street, in early 2023 and an additional 4,000-square-foot facility in Northeast Omaha, at 1021 N 46th Street, in mid-year 2023.
 
We have committed more than half of the funding needed because, through our research and conversations with community partners, we understand how important providing services in these areas is to the local residents.  With the addition of these locations, we will expand access to free training programs, youth programs, and apprenticeships with credentials to residents of these areas, which have the highest unemployment and lowest household incomes. Free upskilling classes and workshops on topics like employability skills, Microsoft Office products, financial literacy, and many more.  Structured learning through state-approved apprenticeships in finance, social services, youth development, warehousing, and Certified Nursing Assistant classes.  With the structured training programs and your help, participants will earn over 1.2 million dollars over the performance period, which will immediately impact the economic vitality of not only the participants but also the communities.

Goodwill will place a focus on resource navigation to help participants mitigate barriers to employment through other partner community resources, intake assessments to align programs and participants for the greatest likelihood of success, and follow-up services with employers and participants to ensure ongoing success. The addition of provided transportation across all of our training locations will make getting services easier for those in need and will expand opportunities for on-the-job learning (OJL) with employers who are not on a bus line.  

The opening of these locations will also create 55 permanent jobs in the areas and prepare residents, who need services, to secure higher-paying entry-level positions in a variety of fields at the completion of training.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Permit sets are into the city on the Southeast Omaha location – when permits are issued construction will finish in early 2023.  Bids have been received on all except furniture which should be complete by end of October 2022. The timeline is uploaded.
An offer has been accepted on the Northeast Omaha location, pending due diligence and closing would happen in January 2023.  This is in the preliminary stages and initial build-out and furniture plans have been roughed in. Our normal procedures will be followed.  This training center would open in the mid-year of 2023. The timeline is uploaded.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> •	The additional two Goodwill Omaha training centers located in Northeast and Southeast Omaha will address sustainable communities in many measurable ways.
o	By expanding opportunities for state-approved apprenticeships in the high-growth, high-demand industries of healthcare, supply chain, public services, and financial services initially. These structured training programs will empower participants to enter the job market with marketable skills and fill open positions.  All of these programs were chosen based on Nebraska Department of Labor data on High-Wage, High-Skill, and High-Demand (H3) job data. These programs not only address the employability needs of our participants but also address the need locally for skilled labor.  Paying participants during classroom instruction and OJL will help them to continue to care for their families and responsibilities while bettering their situation. The demand for workers, the schedules available, working conditions, and starting pay were key drivers to our choices.  This will double the current annual permanent job placements made and increase the overall average wage at placement.
o	As an enhancement to our current processes we will implement a more robust intake process. As part of the enrollment process, participants will spend time upfront completing a series of intake assessments to ensure the biggest chance for success when choosing a program.  We know from experience that most participants needing employment and training services often have additional barriers to success.  Resource navigation personnel will inquire about needs and make referrals to resources at partner organizations to participants. Their Case Manager will review the assessments and work one-on-one with the participant to create an Individualized Development Plan (IDP).  This plan will work as a roadmap to success and outline the needed skill-building and required credentials to place the participant in the chosen career field.  This plan will outline barriers the participants are facing, steps needed to mitigate those barriers, and short-term and long-term goals necessary to achieve the end goal of placement in meaningful permanent employment.  This will double the number of completed credentials, referrals to partner organizations, and the total services provided annually. 
o	Engaging with the community before program creation is paramount to making an impact on residents. Focus groups with internal stakeholders, community partners, employer partners, and potential participants have been completed in Southeast Omaha and are in process with Northeast Omaha. Getting community input upfront and creating needed programs based on what the community wants will double the number of enrollments and services provided to the community annually.
o	Goodwill will expand opportunities for free training workshops for people not enrolled in a structured program. Upskilling with a variety of offerings will give people the chance to advance in their careers and in life. Monthly calendars of classes, at our Southeast Omaha location, including evenings and weekends, will allow for flexibility and access to classes for those who can’t fit professional development into the traditional Monday through Friday, 8:00 am-4:00 pm schedule. This will increase access to our employment and training programs for those who are underemployed and/or self-employed.
•	Goodwill Omaha will address multimodal transportation in a couple of different ways.
o	By adding additional training centers in the Northeast and Southeast parts of Omaha will increase ease and accessibility to our programs for those who have transportation concerns and grow the variety of program availability.  
o	Partnering with Heartland Bike Share to provide access to transportation alternatives to the Metro Buses. 
o	Adding a fleet of vans and providing transportation services not only between our locations but also as a partnership with employers on a shift route basis.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The visioning workshop’s findings that we see alignment within Northeast and Southeast Omaha are:
•	Investing in the community, we will contribute 52.24% of the dollars needed to complete this project and provide programming through June 2026.  We will continue to sustain the locations, jobs, and programs through retail operations support and fundraising efforts after the ARPA funding is over. As we have proven, over our almost 90 years serving the community, when programs are effective we have the ability through our retail operations to sustain them. 
•	Goodwill Omaha made connecting with the communities we serve and using that input as the top priority when making decisions about programming.  We took great care in involving the Southeast Omaha community when planning to open a location in the area.  Over the last year, 13 focus groups have been hosted to provide valuable feedback about the specific needs within Southeast Omaha.  These focus groups were higher-level mixed groups at the beginning of planning and broke out into a few specific groups when drilling into more details.  These groups were community partners, business partners, internal stakeholders, and potential participants.   We have started the same process in Northeast Omaha and will remain actively engaged as programs are defined and implemented.
•	Middle School youth programs will include outreach enrichment based on employability, sustainability, and 21st Century skills.  We will work closely with community partners to align the curriculum with student needs. 
•	High School and Opportunity youth programs will work specifically on employability skills, sector skills, and financial literacy.  This new program would allow students to earn wages during afterschool classroom instruction and those who complete instruction, are guaranteed paid OJL through our retail stores.  Youth who are engaged with programs and employment stay on the right path to becoming contributing additions to the local workforce.
•	Goodwill Omaha’s long history of serving the community has given us the honor of having great partnerships with other organizations that provide complementary support services.  We are committed to growing and maintaining those relationships through a Resource Advisory Council (RAC) where we can discuss trends and challenges as peers and find solutions together.  The RAC ensures that Goodwill Omaha is focused on providing access and tools to leverage community resources and align people with services.
•	At our new Southeast Omaha location, we designed the training center to incorporate three large and one small conference room, providing community spaces and opportunities for other community organizations to provide training and host meetings within Southeast Omaha.  We also created five leased offices for non-profit organizations that are in need of satellite locations which will allow for a more wrap-around approach to serving participants.
•	Goodwill Omaha understands the importance of employers in the creation of training programs to increase opportunities for participants.  The Business Advisory Council (BAC) serves as a mechanism for maintaining high-level conversations with employers regarding the program’s design and effectiveness.  The meetings serve to share information on the program and solicit employer feedback to ensure the project’s relevance and effectiveness given its workforce development focus.  Input is used to inform necessary program modifications or enhancements that strengthen career preparedness.  The BAC facilitates partner involvement in program planning, ongoing OJL training, and adjustments to programming needed to best serve our apprentices.  BAC Members attend quarterly meetings, but also help Goodwill Omaha in other ways.  They conduct mock interviews with participants, critique resumes, host worksite tours, and provide input on programming.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Goodwill Omaha is committing to a financial investment of over 6.5 million into Northeast and Southeast Omaha, together we can empower participants with the skills and knowledge to enter the workforce or advance in the workforce, leading to better-paying jobs and creating generational wealth changes within families.  However, without ARPA funds or community investment, the program offerings will be impacted.
With the approval of this funding, Goodwill Omaha will help foster gainful employment opportunities by providing equitable access to short-term training programs that will lead to jobs for residents creating long-lasting economic growth. 
Programs that empower individuals to make fundamental changes in their lives through gains in skills, education, and earning potential are the most impactful ways to improve the lives of area residents. Providing pay to participants enrolled in these structured programs will make it easier for people to complete programs without worrying as much about financing their basic needs and makes an immediate positive impact on economic vitality within the areas. 
Creating programs with fewer restrictions and eligibility requirements makes it possible to help those who need it most and truly impact communities. Starting learning enrichment early with topics such as employability skills, sustainability, and financial literacy with youth in Middle and High School will help prepare youth to grow into productive members of our community.  Working with youth on communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills will encourage them to play a meaningful part in any team.  Incorporating paid on-the-job learning into programs for youth aged 16 and up will not only allow time to elevate job skills but reward their efforts with a paycheck. 
Incorporating transportation services into structured training programs creates opportunities for people living in these areas to work for employer sponsors that aren’t on a bus line.  It will provide access to non-Goodwill Omaha-sponsored job fairs and resource fairs. This not only helps address the workforce issues that are present throughout Omaha but also expands the earnings potential for participants.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The two additional training centers and one retail store will add 55 jobs to the census tracts.  These are all permanent positions.  We also create opportunities for participants to fill many jobs and anticipate 675 permanent placements at an average starting wage of $15.40 per hour with local employers.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 55</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> unknown</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Training centers will average 43,000 annual wage and retail will average 28,000 per year</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> As an organization focused on workforce development programs, we will work with employers in the area, through our BAC, to help prepare participants to fill the open jobs with businesses in the Qualified Census Tracts and across all of Omaha.  Goodwill Omaha will also work with organizations and businesses through employer sponsorship opportunities for OJL with ongoing follow-up support.  We will connect with employers as a resource for their existing employees that could use assistance with resource navigation.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Goodwill Omaha is making a major investment of time, resources, and dollars to support community growth in Southeast and Northeast Omaha.  For nearly 90 years residents in our communities have turned to Goodwill Omaha (on 72nd & Military) for job training and placement services.  With the growth of our presence in these neighborhoods, we will be able to better serve 13 zip codes comprising the area known as East Omaha.  Goodwill’s programs focus on helping individuals with disabilities and other barriers to employment (such as justice evolved, child care, transportation, lack of education, lack of job skills, and many others).  Participants will utilize services for free and to further eliminate barriers, individuals in these neighborhoods will be provided transportation to attend training and will be supported through job placement. We will improve neighborhoods through education, training, and work, and to transform the trajectory of generational wealth we will provide guidance and training starting with youth in middle school helping them find a path forward.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Communities are stronger when residents are happy, healthy, and safe.  Meaningful employment and skills attainment strengthens families and works toward breaking the cycle of poverty, and in turn, improve the long-term economic situation in these neighborhoods.  Upskilling into higher-paying jobs and advancing in education is a known way to create generational wealth and makes it possible to spend these extra dollars in the neighborhoods they live in.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Upskilling and structured short-term training programs are at the cornerstone of the mission of Goodwill Omaha and Goodwill Industries International.   As an affiliate of Goodwill Industries International (GII), we have support, resources, and tools that are shared by the other 155 affiliates with more than 3,000 locations across the country.  Across this network, almost 2 million people were served in a variety of workforce development services giving 123,000 people placement in employment just last year alone.  We consistently look to GII for interesting and innovative concepts to supplement or enhance our programs. An example of a Goodwill Omaha-created innovative concept that will be added to our programming is our “Goodwill ReImagineers”.  Goodwill Omaha is committed to sustainability and keeps over 6 million pounds of clothing and textiles out of landfills, working toward increasing this every year.  With the ReImagineers program, we would take items that would end up as trash out to Middle Schools and have students use various techniques to upcycle and reinvent what would have been considered trash and turn it into treasures.  Students would collaborate and problem-solve to make fresh items, then students set up shop at the schools or in pop-up shops at Goodwill Omaha retail store classrooms, using their customer service, and budgeting skills to earn money for their program and supplies. Goodwill Omaha is also accredited by CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) which has rigorous standards and audits best practices.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> As part of Goodwill Omaha’s internal balanced scorecard the main outcomes measured each month and cumulatively over the year are: •	Number of job placements made •	Average wage at job placement •	Number of credentials earned by participants •	Number of people served •	Number of services provided •	Number of assessments given •	Number of contact hours provided •	Percentage of participants satisfied with services •	BAC meetings held •	Number of new contacts made with employers •	RAC meetings held •	Number of referrals made to community organizations •	Number of job and resource fairs hosted</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Case Managers and other staff members will document case notes on a daily basis using a case management software system.  Each Program Manager is responsible for updating balanced scorecards each month.  A review of progress toward annual goals is completed by the Program Director and SVP of Mission Advancement prior to the third Thursday of each month.  Trends can be seen and adjustments can be made as needed based on the data.  Also, Goodwill Omaha has a Compliance Manager on staff that uses a fidelity index to audit the case files and metrics on a monthly basis.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Goodwill Omaha has been serving Omaha and the surrounding areas for 89 years.  Over the years we have made relationships and partnerships with most organizations.  An example of some of the organizations that we have relationships with would include Heartland Workforce Solutions (One Stop Operator), National Able, Heart Ministries, Urban League of Nebraska, Department of Labor, Autism Action Partnership, Latino Center of the Midlands, Heart Ministries Center, Catholic Charities, and Nebraska Vocational Rehab.  To give a more detailed example of how these partnerships work: Goodwill is a partner of the One Stop Center at Heartland Workforce Solutions. At least one member of Goodwill is involved in monthly partner meetings regarding local services and how they are being delivered and what steps need to be taken to improve the delivery of such services. Co-enrollment of individuals is done collaboratively with all partner organizations to maximize the services that are being offered to participants to enhance self-sufficiency. Within the one-stop career center, Goodwill works closely with the National Able program that oversees the contract from the federal Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA) program to utilize each organization’s resources to assist individuals with different funding and training options. Another example of partnership is with Heart Ministries, they assist their participants with intensive programs to provide them with essential job and life skills. They refer individuals to Goodwill for assistance with placement after completion of their program. This is because Heart Ministries does not assist with employment placement. This partnership is ideal and contributes to both organizations.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The Northeast training center has an estimated cost of $423,500 with closing costs. The Southeast training center is a long-term lease.  Included in the budget is an allocated portion of the lease and common area maintenance charges for the training center’s square footage.  The retail store will use revenue earned to cover all other costs and nothing but total construction is included in this request.
The Northeast training center is 4,000 square feet and construction costs are estimated at $229,202 bringing the cost per square foot to $57.30. Construction costs total $2,243,014 for the Southeast training center which is 16,000 square feet and the retail store with a production area of 22,000 square feet bringing the cost per square foot to $59.02.  
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment cost in the request for the Northeast training center total $415,480.  
•	This includes $322,000 in costs for two fourteen-passenger vans, four seven-passenger vans, and two KIA Soul small outreach vehicles and vehicle wraps.
•	The remaining amount is for desks, chairs, training tables, and computer equipment
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment cost in the request for the Southeast training center total $550,000.  
•	This includes $100,000 in retail fixtures.
•	The remaining amount is for desks, chairs, training tables, and computer equipment
Northeast training center programming costs for June through December 2023, FY2024, FY2025, and January through July 2026 total $2,873,256.

The attached budget details each element in more detail.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The requested amount will cover all of the furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FFE) for the Northeast Omaha training center and some of the FFE at the Southeast location, all transportation vehicles and fuel costs, all participants’ wages, and some of the wages, taxes, and benefits for other added jobs.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The 2.6 million in program support for all additional years will be sustained through our retail operations and philanthropic requests.  In 2021 Goodwill Omaha put 1.019 million in retail operations support to fund existing programs, this year we are on track to be close to 2 million in retail support.  As you can see on the proforma attached we have forecasted the ongoing impact on our organization and with minimal external support will be able to continue programs as long as they are needed.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> We are consistently looking for funding opportunities.  We generally focus on federal and state opportunities.  We have also reached out to the Suzanne and Walter Scott Foundation which will revisit our request for application in December 2022.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> We have requested funding support from: •	Robert B Daugherty Foundation $475,000 – pending - unknown decision date •	First National Bank of Omaha $80,000 – pending – Decision expected by year-end •	The Hawks Foundation $50,000 – pending – Decision expected by year-end •	The William and Ruth Scott Foundation $50,000 – pending Decision expected in December 2022</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> The transportation portion of this request cannot happen without your support and would be the first element eliminated. Participant wages would be one element that would be difficult to implement without support, totaling $1,249,457.  Also, the number of people to be served would be reduced as a reduction of staff most likely would happen without support, with approximately nine fewer jobs created due to the smaller scale.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Somewhat</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> We have started construction on the Southeast Omaha training center and entered into a purchase agreement on the Northeast Omaha training center.  We will follow through with providing services in both locations.  The transportation element, capacity to be served, number of jobs created, and participant support could be reduced and would reduce the amount of funding needed.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Goodwill Omaha has committed to funding 52.24% of the whole budget totaling $6,585,000 through July 2026 and over 2.6 million every year after.</p>
