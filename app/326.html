  <p> Carnation Place</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 1500000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 1500000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Carnation Place, located in the landmarked Carnation Ballroom property at North 24th & Miami Streets will be a commercial redevelopment of a culturally significant property. Over the next two years, this project will house three to five businesses and will incubate and catalyze entrepreneurship and commerce on North 24th Street. Smaller projects like Carnation Place are absolutely critical to support and validate larger investments and projects in the area. The North 24th Street business district by its very definition needs multiple diverse businesses in various properties to come online together to create a sustainable destination space.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> This project will take approximately 18 months to complete. It will begin in Q1, 2023 and target a grand opening in Q2, 2024. The first work will begin with permitting, procurement and marketing. Next, infrastructure services will be restored to the property including domestic water, sewer, natural gas, commercial electrical service and broadband high speed internet access.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Carnation Ballroom, an embellished historic masonry structure, has served near North Omaha for nearly 100 years, beginning as the Forbes Bakery, continuing on as the AmVets of World War II social club and earning cultural landmark status as Mildred Brown’s acclaimed historic ballroom in the 1950’s. During the Carnation Ballroom period, acts such as B.B. King, Fats Domino and James Brown performed at the venue. Reactivation of this space for use by the public will continue this multi generational and multi cultural narrative and allow the property to serve the community for the next century. This will improve the quality of life by instilling pride and a sense of belonging in the neighborhood that connects past generations to the future.

Restoration of the existing building is the epitome of sustainability. While structurally and environmentally stabilized, the building currently needs reconnection to municipal infrastructure services such as water, sewer, gas, electricity and broadband internet.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project aligns with the workshop vision by revitalizing and transforming a vacant, dilapidated building into a commercial community hub that will provide employment, goods and services to area residents, visitors and tourists alike. While welcoming customers, this property will continue to tell the story of rich diversity and culture and inspire people to mingle and build connections.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Transformational: The Carnation Place multi tenant commercial project will transform the block at 24th and Miami from a derelict site into a dynamic commercial hub. 

Fundamental Change: This project will foster hope and entrepreneurship in the neighborhood by showcasing thriving, professionally operated local businesses in an area that is often characterized by vandalism, theft, vacant and abandoned buildings. Carnation Place will prove the viability of independently operated businesses in the near North 24th Street business district and pave the way for further private investment.

Long Lasting Economic Growth: Carnation Place is a masonry building built to stand for generations. The high quality workmanship recently completed in a CDBG stabilization project ensures that this building will serve the community for generations to come.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Approximately 20 high paying jobs will be created during the construction phase of the project. A minimum of 15 jobs will be created by the businesses that occupy Carnation Place, ranging from retail to professional services.
