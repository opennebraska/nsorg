  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Our proposal is unique in many ways. In the following paragraphs, we will prove why we believe our proposal to be the very best in all areas of community growth, job creation, increased health awareness, and equally if not more importantly, the education of today's youth in lower-income situations, to ensure a more significant opportunity for those in South & North Omaha.  

Our objective is to develop transformational soft skills in ages ranging from five through high school graduation.  Our connection with "Find a Why" gives us a vehicle into OPS and local athletics. Over 24,000 kids are currently enrolled in "Find a Why.‚Äù We will utilize the OPS curriculum, and hire qualified educational specialists to ensure consistency in every classroom. We will also utilize athletics to teach life skills such as perseverance, hard work, dedication, and following through with a goal. We also want to educate on financial management, because it contributes to the ongoing financial struggles in North and South Omaha. We believe utilizing our proposal within our program can drastically curve financial instability and build up the next generation of positive and confident leaders in this community.

Having a state-of-the-art facility will contribute to the desire to utilize the facility, as well as the education provided within our program. Many issues that North and South Omaha also experience are due to transportation issues. Our management team has identified a way to curve this issue. We know we can accomplish this by incorporating bus routes to bring the youth to and from our facility. This will also assist in building more jobs due to staffing needs. Our objective is to become the facility in which North and South Omaha can make a staple in our community for generations to come. With this facility, community engagement will increase and sustain. 

In conclusion, our proposal is one of a kind. We see a different dream. Without displacement and including local business donations to our cause, we can develop everything requested in the grant, within the timeline required. Our facility request is 10 million dollars to complete and sustain this project.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal will positively affect a sustainable community and raise the quality
of life in North and South Omaha.
 
	With Dwayne Hosey and Tyler Cloyd' involvement with the "Find a Why" platform we already have a vehicle into O.P.S. giving
us 24,000 children ages 8-14 who could start benefiting from the facility immediately upon completion through before and after
school programs.

  The youth of North and South Omaha will have access in addition to some of the best baseball training in the state, services 
including, but not limited to: education, recreation,strength/conditioning training,nutritional education, and the arts

Examples of soft skills: Communication, Teamwork, Critical thinking, Decision making, Conflict management, Leadership, and
Creativity

 Sports promote soft skill development (soft skills are interpersonal and behavioral skills that enable someone to interact
effectively and harmoniously with other people) development of these skills from a young age is pivotal to success in the
classroom and success in the class room is pivotal to success in life.

"Students who recognize the importance of soft skills on time are able to master their studies more successfully, complete their 
student obligations smoothly, make more acquaintances that may prove useful in the future, and better present themselves to 
professors who can also play an important role in their future careers." - Allison Academy 

Our goal is to equip the youth of North and South Omaha with soft skills through athletic training and an O.P.S. provided
curriculum to ensure they lead more fulfilling and prosperous lives. These well equipped young men and women will become far more
than just the future leaders of these communities. They will be given the opportunity to start thinking and feeling differently 
about North and South Omaha as the places where they were prepared for life, not just simply where they lived.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The youth in the communities of North and South Omaha will have access to training and programs that will help advance them 
through their education and athletics seeing many more of these young men and women given the opportunity to earn a college degree 
through academic and athletic scholarships.

This facility will diversify North and south Omahas' economy in a plethora of ways. The level of training particularly baseball 
coupled with Dwayne and Tylers connections with Major League Baseball will bring an influx of business from outside sources to 
these communities. In particular around The College World Series some of the best college hitters and pitchers in the country and 
thousands of baseball adoring tourists will be Coming to North and South Omaha for lessons and/or training or just to check the
place out and visit with Dwayne and Tyler.

These visitors will not only be spending money on baseball, they will all have to eat, some will need haircuts their cars will
need gasoline etc.

 Sports provide the youth with skills and tools to overcome 
challenges, inspire positive change and pass it back to their communities. By building bridges and creating connections sports
 become a platform to give voice to the disenfranchised and change perceptions about those marginalized in the community.

Many studies from extremely credible sources have shown that sports and physical activity can significantly
boost students' cognitive and effective foundation. It can have a profound impact on quality of life in many ways.</p>
