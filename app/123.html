  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Building upon the 70+years of the Thomas Funeral Home, the RJ THOMAS FUNERAL HOME PROJECT by J3FR&R LLC (Applicant) proposes to provide a new and sorely needed modern funeral home owned by members of the Thomas family that have worked at Thomas Funeral Home. The project location at 3510 North 33rd Street was the site of a former industrial facility but is now mostly vacant and unused. The Site is adjacent to the Malcom X Memorial and a substantial number of homes built by Habitat for Humanity. 

The Applicant owns the site without debt, and has performed soil and environmental studies, topographical survey, and preliminary designs. With a successful Grant award, we will be able to complete the construction plans and start construction in September 2023 and be fully operational by May 2024. 

The Project transforms vacant ground into a viable new black-owned business increases services in the community, works with numerous non-profit groups and community agencies, and creates 60 temporary jobs, 33 permanent jobs, and trains at least 7 new funeral directors and 4 new embalmers in the first five years.

Funeral directors and embalmers are high-paying careers in high demand. There is a lack of minority funeral directors and embalmers, and this Project will be the only training program in the Metro for apprentice funeral directors and embalmers. Some of those graduates could go on to own their own funeral homes or embalming businesses serving funeral homes. 

The proposed project costs are $12,683,996, of which $1,259,367 would be covered through the applicant’s current invested funds of $428,337 and projected NOI of $831,030. The project is profitable and sustainable after Year 2 of the Program. The Project increases the tax base and is projected to generate over $150,000 in sales taxes over the first five years. 

To achieve the Grant’s objective of maximizing the economic impact of the project by using businesses in the QCTs we have retained Midwest Diversity Consulting. They will be responsible for reaching the goal of 60% of the project contracts being awarded to minority owned, disadvantaged owned, and other businesses located within QCTs.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The RJ Thomas Funeral Home creates a sorely needed locally-owned new and modern funeral home, adding service to the area, with significant economic impact and growth of ancillary businesses serving the clients of the funeral home. In addition, the Project will create the only training program for new funeral directors and embalmers in Omaha.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Project represents a substantial investment in the community, and spurs investment by supporting other community-based businesses, increases services, creates a substantial number of high-paying new jobs, creates the only training program for funeral directors and embalmers in the Omaha area, uses a vacant lot, and creates a new black-owned business that is prosperous and sustainable.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The proposed project fully aligns with LB 1024's strategic priorities by transforming a vacant former industrial site into a cutting edge business service the community, further TRANSFORMING the surrounding QCTs with the high paying jobs the Project provides, and trains for. This represents not only a FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE in the 33rd & Evans neighborhood, but also in the employment and quality of life of households in the QCTs served by the Project and the vendors of the Project. With the jobs created and trained for, the beneficial increase in business for community vendors serving the operations of the Project, and the expected profitability and self-sustaining operations, this Project is poised for LONG- LASTING ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND GROWTH.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The North Omaha QCTs lack modern accessible funeral facilities. This new business will dramatically transform and improve the large vacant former industrial site it occupies, while providing a significant lasting impact with the new jobs this black-owned business will create, and the new funeral directors and embalmers this Project will train. Many of the apprentices will be from the neighborhood, may be covid-impacted, and will fill a great need for minority funeral directors and embalmers. Many of the businesses that this Project will support have been covid-impacted, and the economic impact from this Project will help grow their businesses, and potentially help them provide new jobs to other unemployed workers who may have been impacted by covid as well.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The proposed project makes significant transformative investment in the community, transforms an abandoned dilapidated vacant industrial site into a job-creating engine, provide modern much needed funeral and crematory services. There will even be a community room that can be rented for events, ro provided for free use by neighborhood and non-profit groups.</p>

It is east of the Malcom X Memorial site, and among numerous new Habit for Humanity-built homes. The vacant site currently is an attractive nuisance for trash, litter, and shenanigins, and detracts from a neighborhood trying to transform.</p>
