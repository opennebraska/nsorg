  <h3>ProposalType</h3>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Company is prepared to introduce the following service to the market:
Early Childhood Education and Childcare: Empowering Kids Academy is a licensed childcare center and preschool program
that provides high quality childcare for children ages 6 weeks to 13 years of age. We offer traditional schedules, part-time
schedules, drop-in care, before and after school care and summer programs for school age children.
Our program provides a unique environment and philosophy. We are are small, family oriented program. The owners of
Empowering Kids Academy are also the directors allowing us to be heavily involved daily and in the building at all times.
Unlike most childcare centers we have started Empowering Kids Academy from the ground up as a small in-home childcare
program. Our owners/directors have a vast amount of knowledge and expertise in the field of early childhood education.
Children at EKA are more then just a number, we value relationships, connections and family. As owners we make this a
priority and a way of conducting business. We are fully invested in the families we provide care to. Parents, children and
families will be impressed with our open layout and design. Not only do children have classrooms that meet their
developmental needs but there are plenty of oppurtunities for play and exploration in our indoor playground, theater room and
art/science center! Empowering Kids Academy invites several community partners for basketball, soccer, yoga, dance,
cooking, foreign languages and much more so our kiddos are always engaged while acquiring new and exciting skills. We have successfully accomplished this with our location in West Omaha and now want to bring all EKA has to offer to North Omaha and give the families and children in this area the early childhood education they need and deserve. We are hoping to find the perfect location within 6-12 months and then begin the building process which may take 12-36 months based on the build out process.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> This proposal has a flexible timeline. Our goal would be to find the location and or land within 6-12 months and begin the building process</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> An early childhood education center can provide high quality education to this community. There is currently a lack of high quality childcare centers that provide early childhood education. Many families are left with no childcare and therefore can not find jobs. Our center will provide education for our future leaders and get parents into the working field. High education and job placement for parents improves the quality of the community and neighborhood. The location of the center can also improve neighborhoods by providing an outdoor space for the community</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> A high quality early childhood education center adds future sustainability to the community by giving back to the future leaders.</p>
