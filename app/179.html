  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> I, Charles Hill, Jr., am a first-time entrepreneur seeking to realize my vision of creating affordable pocket neighborhood housing on a vacant lot in an established neighborhood.  I was born and raised in this neighborhood and have maintained strong ties to it ever since.  The lot has been cleared of the mature trees that once stood there and is now ready for development.

For the past 17 years, I have been steadily employed with Omaha Public Power District as an Electrical Line Technician.  I am a hard worker with a strong work ethic.  I am now ready to take on the role of entrepreneur, with the goal of helping people in North Omaha achieve their dreams of home ownership and the creation of generational wealth for their families.

Goals – My goal is to transform an unused, vacant lot in an established area by building affordable, residential, pocket neighborhood homes that provide: 

•	value for the community;
•	affordable housing options;
•	community re-development;
•	expanded usage of land and resources;
•	a revenue stream for the city; and
•	opportunities for home ownership. 

This proposal could also potentially spark new interest in the neighborhood and attract new connections, other developers and businesses who may want to invest here.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> My proposal fills current gaps in housing, develops low usage land, meets affordable housing needs, revitalizes an older, well established neighborhood with new growth, adds to Omaha’s tax base through property taxes, and provides new customers for nearby surrounding retail businesses.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> My proposal pursues the growing and popular “pocket neighborhood” concept of building a small cluster of homes gathered around a shared open space.  Pocket neighborhoods are designed to provide a natural scale of sociability and a sense of community, while preserving personal privacy.  This project will bring in new construction and enhanced housing for entry-level and next-level families.  It also will produce well built, lasting homes that promote generational wealth through home ownership.  It also re-energizes an existing underserved, underdeveloped neighborhood.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> My proposal provides: 

•	access to safe, high quality housing; housing affordability at market rates ;
•	accessible housing opportunities for all income levels;
•	mixed income housing;
•	affordable housing for working people;
•	access to affordable housing; and
•	more affordable and mixed income housing to increase density (for retirees, 
 first-time home buyers and working class/middle income households).</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> My proposal aligns with LB1024’s strategic priorities as follows:

•	It helps improve the housing density in the community;
•	It is targeted to provide new housing within 18 months of the start of construction; and
•	In developing this new “pocket neighborhood” community, the required public and private infrastructure will include utilities to the residents and the laying of drinking water mains, lines, pipes, or channels.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> My proposal provides opportunities for creating generational wealth, along with providing community construction job opportunities.  It also produces the economic impact to local businesses which accompanies increased home ownership.  It also increases the community tax base through property taxes.  My plan includes development of a Home Ownership Association (HOA) to maintain home exteriors, lawns, roads, driveways and sidewalks.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Permanent jobs will be created for the landscaping, lawn maintenance and snow removal on the street, sidewalks and driveways.  Permanent jobs also will be created for painting provided by the HOA.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Potentially up to 100 construction jobs will be created.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Wage levels would be higher than minimum-wage-paying jobs, as the average construction wage pays $20 or more per hour.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The HOA will provide ongoing jobs, but the new residents will also provide increased revenue for the surrounding businesses and economy.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> This project provides a community benefit by:

•	adding density to the Hartman Avenue Neighborhood Association community;

•	reinvigorating an older, established neighborhood with housing opportunities for entry-level, middle-class and senior individuals;  

•	producing affordable housing options that promote the creation of generational wealth for persons who haven’t previously had that opportunity;

•	creating community construction job opportunities;

•	producing the positive economic impact to local businesses which accompanies increased home ownership;

•	increasing the community tax base through property taxes; and

•	creating a positive sense of community through a Home Ownership Association that will maintain home exteriors, lawns, driveways and the new street.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal:

•	strengthens the existing community;
•	provides affordable housing choices; and
•	provides stability, quality, safety and affordability.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The “pocket neighborhood” is a new and innovative concept that is gaining popularity around the country.  It provides a new housing option in an established neighborhood.  It also provides housing units on smaller lots that are easier to maintain, and which are less expensive and more affordable.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The outcome will allow my business to continually invest in the Hartman Avenue community with more affordable, quality housing for entry-level families, next-level families and seniors.  The outcome will increase the tax base and provide economic growth by adding more customers for nearby local businesses.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> When these homes are eventually re-sold by their new owners, they will provide instant equity for these individuals, and produce the generational wealth opportunities which accompany home ownership.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> No, but these homes will provide increased equity for their owners over time.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> I will work with the Hartman Avenue Neighborhood Association to provide information and promote and market this development.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> None at present, as such partnerships are contingent upon receiving approval and funding to move forward with this proposal.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> I considered all cost funding allocations, as well as the anticipated costs associated with inflation.  To build these quality, mixed density, affordable homes, I had to take into account the costs for construction, engineering, architecture, surveying, legal easements, acquisition of the lot, clearance of the many large (living and dead) trees for site preparation, as well as marketing and promotion expenses.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Grant funds will be used for utility infrastructure, roadway, sidewalk, lighting, landscaping, engineering, design, construction and marketing.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> After the initial investment, I do not foresee any ongoing fiscal operations.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> I submitted an intent letter to the Qualified Census Tract Affordable Housing Program on October 7, 2022.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> A Letter of Intent was submitted on October 7, 2022 to the Qualified Census Tract Affordable Housing Program.    The Application Close Date is October 18, 2022.  All grant funds must be obligated by December 31, 2024, and all grant funds expended by December 31, 2026.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Yes.  This proposal is entirely dependent on the Omaha Economic Recovery Act Bill (LB 1024) Grant.  My project cannot proceed with this funding.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes, this proposal is scalable.  However, with a smaller funding amount, the scope of the project would be reduced in size.  For example, the number of homes to be built would be fewer than the five homes I am currently hoping to build on the unused, vacant lot.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> This project proposal is intended for maximum impact and most efficient usage of space.  As previously noted, the project can be scaled back to divide the unused space into fewer lots that would be bigger in square footage, but this would also reduce the number of homes to be built to fewer than five.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Dean Enterprise, LLC has acquired the vacant lot and paid the financial expense towards land clearing (removal of many old, mature trees).  Dean Enterprise, LLC has also paid for the Land Surveyor’s Certification.</p>
