  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Bison and its subsidiary companies have completed a variety of projects in or near qualified census tracts that that have laid the framework for the success of this proposal, which include: (1) The acquisition of a manufacturing and processing company (Nebraska Scientific) and the relocation of the company to North Omaha, providing 20 jobs to the area. (2) The acquisition and expansion of a national grounds maintenance company (U.S. Grounds Maintenance) south of Omaha in Bellevue, NE. (3) The acquisition and expansion of a national roofing company (EverSeal), including completing a feasibility study on the manufacturing of its key product. (4) A current three building retail and mixed-use development that will consist of over 80,000 square feet upon completion in late 2023 in Heartwood Preserve.</p>

  <p> 10000000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Bison plans to build a 50,000+ sq ft flex building in North Omaha to support several of Bison’s existing companies in a diverse group of industries which will immediately provide 30 to 50 significant jobs to the area with high potential for expansion and additional job creation over the next 3 years.  

Bison’s company EverSeal currently purchases several million dollars of sealant annually from major supplier like Sherwin Williams and General Electric and has already completed a study on manufacturing this sealant in-house. EverSeal’s current uses alone will create around 20 high paying manufacturing jobs with the potential for more as EverSeal expands throughout the U.S. (EverSeal has doubled in size, both EE count and revenue, in the past 18 months). Additional expansion by EverSeal is expected to double the amount of sealant needed over the future 18 months which will in turn double the manufacturing capabilities needed. EverSeal currently applies its sealant (which includes a 50 year no leak guaranty) exclusively through the use of its own employees, an opportunity exists to expand into retail sales of the EverSeal sealant which could greatly increase the manufacturing demand for the product. 

Another of Bison’s companies, U.S. Grounds Maintenance, provides high quality grounds maintenance services to government and commercial customers through the U.S. including Offutt Airforce Base and its privatized housing, Rising View. A consideration in selecting which projects to bid is proximity to the site or “windshield time”, which makes It impractical to complete projects in North Omaha at this time. U.S. Grounds would immediately take space in the new flex building in order to commence work on grounds maintenance contracts in the region, creating an immediate need for 10-20 jobs and likely expansion as additional contracts are secured, most being government contracts providing significant wages and benefits under the McNamara O’Hara Service Contract Act.  

Bison also has a significant need for technological and customer support roles to support its various companies and would utilize the flex building as an innovation center that teaches people to code, hires programmers and developers, has R&D labs, a provides customer service center.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Bison's proposal will help energize North Omaha by using the resources available (land, workforce) to create significant opportunities for the community through jobs and capital development, a truly transformational project. The jobs and development supported by the project will help lead to additional investment in the community by other businesses looking to locate in the area, tax revenue, and from the workforce which will primarily consist of North Omaha residents who will reinvest their wages back into the community.  

This project will also achieve the policy goals of the Act though its diverse job creation (manufacturing, heavy equipment operators, technology, etc.) which will require training and education of applicants throughout the community.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Visioning Workshop performed a SWOT analysis of North Omaha which findings align with this project in several key areas.  

A key threat to the community was the aging infrastructure cited as a barrier for attracting investments and maintaining a quality of life. This project helps revitalize areas within the community through the development of our proposed facility and the jobs it will create which will directly address this threat.  

Similarly, an opportunity was identified to develop the vacant parcels of land within North Omaha and to leverage the current residents and entrepreneurial efforts into additional economic activity. This project will immediately take advantage of the opportunity to utilize the vacant land, and through the creation of jobs and training provided, will provide significant opportunities for residents to use these skills to create more companies and jobs, spurring even further economic activity. This will help address a weakness of the SWOT analysis as well – that economic investment does not always recycle within the community. The jobs and training achieved through this project will certainly need to additional investment within the community.  

Most importantly, this project will play to the strengths of the community. The culture and character are integrated in the neighborhoods which will lead to a robust and capable workforce. The economic hubs proximate to North Omaha allow for a manufacturing and situation center such as this to flourish, as we have already seen firsthand with our company, Nebraska Scientific.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024 was implemented to provide communities that were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 the resources needed to respond to the pandemic and build a stronger and more equitable economy in recovery from its effects. The capital investment, training, and job creation from this project will directly strengthen areas within Omaha that were severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic which were identified by the committee as the qualified census tracts.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> See below, approximately 30-50 permanent jobs immediately and the likely creation of an additional 30-50 jobs over the next 3 years. Salary ranges between $40,000 and $80,000 annually. Additional construction jobs created on a temporary basis.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Immediate creation of 30-50 jobs with the likely creation of an additional 30-50 jobs over the next 3 years.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Numerous constructions jobs will be created to build the facility over a 1-2 year period, number of jobs TBD once plans are completed and bids are submitted.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> $40,000 through $80,000 annually</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The jobs created will provide a diverse set of skills (manufacturing, heavy equipment operators, technology focused) which are highly transferable and will provided additional benefits to other businesses within the qualified census tracts.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Redelveopment of underutilized areas and job creation are core benefits of this project which will significantly improve the community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Capital investment and job creation provided from this project will help utilize vacant land within the community and create new well-paying jobs for the residents. This investment in the community and its residents will cause a chain reaction of investment and improvement of the entire neighborhood.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Bison has already completed other projects that lay the groundwork for this undertaking, including the relocation of Nebraska Scientifics manufacturing facility to North Omaha and it can take the lessons learned from that relocation and apply them to this project. Further, the technology hub component that Bison is able to support will bring fresh innovation to the North Omaha region.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> As previously stated, this proposal will lead to well-paying jobs and training opportunities for applicants through continuing education in a variety of fields.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The project team will prioritize measurement of these factors and welcomes continued measurement by the city of Omaha and the committee.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes of course, creation of facilities and jobs within the community leads to additional investment, both from other businesses looking to locate there and from employees who have learned some of the skills required to provide additional investment within the community.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Yes, we have discussed partnerships with foundations that provide job placement, advancement and training and would look to develop these partnerships as part of the project.  Exact organizations TBD.</p>
