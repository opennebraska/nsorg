  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Edmonson Youth Outreach has been a pillar in the north Omaha community for over 45 years. Joe Edmondson passed away in 2002. Prior to his passing Edmonson Youth Outreached developed over a half a dozen innovative programs to reach inner city youth. The wrestling program is perhaps the most well known in the community but other programs such as the summer fun program, after school program, local radio station and broadcasting programs lead the way. This proposal is intended to revive past programs and introduce new programs.</p>
