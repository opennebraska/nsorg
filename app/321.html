Social Well-Being will be provided by the Spotlight Comedy House’s Pop Up Series located in a safe and credible place such as The Holland Center and/or Omaha Design Center, which are places that foster expression through the arts. The partnership with The Holland & Omaha Design Center will create a direct connection with the North Omaha community & downtown community.
