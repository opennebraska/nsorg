  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Outlook Properties, LLC, currently owned by Outlook Nebraska (collectively “Outlook”), offers an opportunity to advance the nonprofits mission of impacting the lives of the visually impaired.  It aims to advance the lives by providing employment opportunities utilizing adaptive technology training, including incorporating technology, manufacturing, and other related services.  Founded in 2000, Outlook has enriched the lives of the visually impaired through a variety of programs, but notably utilizing adaptive technologies for tissue production and back office services.  Today, the organization is the largest employer of the blind in over a 7-state region.

Outlook and White Lotus Group (“WLG”) have established a joint venture for the development of the 11.7 parcel located at 6935 F Street in Omaha.  The project would leverage WLG’s industrial expertise to expand Outlook’s mission by providing added space for manufacturing, distribution and warehousing.  Over 35,000 Nebraskans report blindness or sever difficulty seeing even with glasses.   As a result of the disability, the majority face poverty, and only a fraction is offered program assistance.  

This will work towards:
•	Lowering unemployment rate for the blind and visually impaired workforce
•	Building greater independence among those without sight or those losing their sight
•	Guiding those beginning their journey of self-discovery and self-reliance
•	Teaching our communities how to embrace those with varying needs
•	Connecting with other organizations who share our vision
•	Educating business leaders on inclusivity and workplace adaptability
•	Working with elected officials in creating more opportunities for the blind or visually impaired
•	Raising the quality of life for those with no vision or low vision

The Project would facilitate the expansion of that mission by provided a 150,000 sf expansion on top of a brownfield site on the Outlook campus.  The Project team has been assembled, city entitlements and approvals have been received, and given an allocation of Omaha Economic Recovery funds, it is ready to start.

Lastly, the Project represents a rare opportunity to build industrial/manufacturing product within the center of the city which expands jobs availabilities within the city's core.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Project aims to solve poverty for the visually impaired by creating educational and employment opportunities.  Currently this is conducted adjacent to the Project site, and at its peak employed over 100 blind or nearly blind employees for the production of tissue products to the federal government as well as recently offering back office services to businesses.  Providing an opportunity to improve the quality of life to the nearly 35,000 Nebraskans that suffer vision disabilities could be aided by the expansion of Outlooks's mission.  The location is on a major multimodal site, and would address environmental challenges to the area by solving historic toxic materials.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Educates and Enhances Employment (in this case to an already vulnerable poplulation)
Successful implementation would mitigate the need from public support.
Redevelops a troubled piece of vacant ground with environmental challenges</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Employment - there is a lack of new distribution and warehouse space within QCTs (or nearby). This would be a rare opportunity.
Economic Development 
Safe redevelopment of unsafe area (environmental)
Utilizes multimodal transportation which will improve Project success and mitigate historic disparities</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We believe the project will create 100s of jobs over time.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 100s</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 50</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> $30000 to $150,000</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> WE would implement a 5% project set aside for minority and disadvantaged subcontractors</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> This project will diversify economic development and support to an often forgotten population that currently relies on financial support.  By creating educational programs and ultimately employment opportunities both inside and outside the organization, the Project will improve the lives of our community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Expands our current workforce
Creates job opportunities for the visually impaired
Will improve the quality of life greatly for those in need
Solves the redevelopment of a environmentally challenged brownfield site.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Job Creation, Improved Education for both employers and visually impaired employees</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Outlook Nebraska can measure patrons served and placement (they produce an annual impact report), and the Department of Labor should be able to track jobs created.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> yes in that it expands employment potential for visually impaired, and facilitates new businesses to join the manufacturing/distribution facility.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Due to 501c3 nature, the project is oversized to introduce other users and subsidize the overall cost of occupancy to the organization.  Given the size of the project, the environmental challenges, and the inflationary pressures (cost of debt and cost to build), the project requires assistance</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> It will be used for Site improvements, environmental monitoring and compliance, and development of the facility.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Outlook Nebraska and WLG both have reporting requirements.  WLG would facilitate the reporting requirements associated with the physical development of the Project, and how the set aside was implemented and achieved.   Funds would be drawn and paid for monthly payment applications, and then reimbursements would be sought from the ARPA program.  Outlook would report separately its 501c3 programming and associated grant reporting requirements.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Outlook has raised funds for the acquisition of the Land.
TIF has been approved by the Omaha City Council.
Debt would be guaranteed by WLG & Outlook
