Create beautiful landscaping areas to promote walking areas. Creates 30+ affordable units in an area that needs it.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The renovation of the Historic Corby Theater and Apartment building at 2801 N. 16th Street is in census tract 12.00, which is a qualified census tract. This development will be a beacon and an anchor for development for 16th street which is a main corridor. This development will have 3 retail spaces that will be offered to businesses that cater to the north Omaha area. It will also provide affordable housing to an area that needs it.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>

This is in conjunction with developments along 16th and Binney streets to connect these areas to make beautiful, walkable, safe areas where the community can feel proud to walk and gather in these areas.

This promotes community sustainability by not demolishing old and dilapidated buildings but promoting adaptive reuse to rebuild trust between communities and community leaders.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Instead of demolishing old buildings, not only will this be redeveloped but will use 50% of electrical energy from rooftop solar power with 300 panels and a 16 hour battery. It can be a beacon that the Solar tax Credit can bring great value to older buildings in need of new roof.</p>
