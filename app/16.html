  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> South Omaha Education and Community Center at South High School</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 28000000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 15000000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> This new center will feature a highly visible dramatic facade which will open into a commons area perfect for community and school gatherings, events in the studio theatre, exhibits at the art gallery or home athletic events.  This ensures that all students invested in the arts can fully participate and succeed.  It solidifies South High School's committment to community investment by providing facilities and programs to benefit the vibrant South Omaha neighborhood. This new center will expand community partnerships with leading arts organizations around the region, will create new job opportunities in education in the fine and performing arts. The facility will be located at the south end of the school near the corner of 24th and L Streets. No existing businesses will be affected. Wells Fargo located at 24th and L Street has offered parking for all events.  (See timeline below)</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Fundraising began in earnest in August of 2021.  All private donations are anticipated to be received by April 15, 2023.  Alley Poyner anticipates construction to be completed within 18 months of all secured funding.  The ground breaking is anticipated to be July 1, 2023.  Grand opening ceremonies are anticipated to occur by January of 2025.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The South Omaha community has identified a strong need for fine and performing arts opportunities through a series of surveys conducted by Canopy South.  While this new facility will also provide updated athletic event space, the primary goal of the new center is to enrich, enhance and educate through the arts.  There is no current facility in the vicinity that offers a state of the art comprehensive building to hold events, classes, workshops that will enhance every age group in the area. Thanks to engaged community partners, South Omaha revitalization is continually emerging to improve infrastructure and connects all aspects from business to education to social emotional well-being.  A 2002 Princeton University study revealed "that there is a measurable impact that the arts pose on communities.  The study showed a correlation between strong arts participation and presence and prosperity in a community, economically, socially and individually."</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> A primary goal of this project is to ensure equity through the arts through access, high quality state of the art facilities, and opportunities for growth for all members of the community (personal, cultural, social/emotional).  Another priority is to enhance infrastructure.  This $28m project is unique because it focuses entirely on community enrichment through access to the arts.  It is also anticipated that it will attract exceptional arts organizations and opportunities.Schools are most often viewed as a cornerstone of any community, Omaha South High School is no exception.  This project ensures that the community is an active partner in the future of the growth of South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project enhances the new housing initiatives in the area because successful communities have proven that expanded arts venues/experiences/access attracts people to its uniqueness. "Through the arts, diverse participants can learn to share and hear each other differently, increase understanding and manage conflict.  Arts-based engagement gives more diverse groups a stake in overall community change." (Jackson Hole, Wy, Chamber of Commerce 2/2021). The Omaha Chamber of Commerce states that if a student can make more than $5000 over his parents, it adds $168m in economic impact. Arts and Culture adds nearly $60B more than construction and $227B more than transportation and warehousing to the US ecomomy (arts.gov 2019).</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> For example - in the realm of afterschool community classes that will be offered, it is anticipated that more than two dozen new workshops/lessons/programs will be offered through new employment.  The venue itself will create new jobs through technicians, maintenance, administration, accounting and human resources.  It will also provide income for visiting artists (dance companies, artists in residency, vocal ensembles, etc.).  The way that the facility is designed to have a centralized ticketing and events common space, the result will be to expand small business interaction with all patrons through a variety of mediums.  This $28m project will favorably impact employment through engineers, consultants, electrical, plumbing, transportation, purchasing, and construction.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Professional wage levels average of $100k for 20 people; construction labor (general contractors) $40-$50k for 60 people;  $3.5m-$4m on wages for the project.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Omaha Public Schools has a proven process and track record of working primarily with professionals in the workforce within the designated area.  In addition, OPS requires a percentage of the design and construction team to qualify as emerging businesses.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> We have engaged the National Endowment of the Arts and are working on data related to employment rates and future wage growth related to education in the arts for this project.  This project will create the connection of the public's small businesses and connecting them to education in an innovative way.  It provides access and presence for education in South Omaha which has never been realized.  It will also be a new regional draw which brings in artists, patrons and other venues that will change the local economy.  Those educated in the arts will work within the community to continue to improve public spaces.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Communities with strong arts programs are more economically viable by creating quality public space and infrastructure.  It also diversifies arts patrons and participants!  This is a much needed transformational project to provide the opportunity to level the equity and access in South Omaha and beyond.  South High School is an educational facility that has represented South High as a community and cultural cornerstone for 124 years.  This project would maintain the pride and tradition while moving forward as a transformational and equitable education facility to be utilized by the entire community.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> This new center will provide innovative space for education, participation, and community growth. It will create synergies between the local business community and students providing access to opportunities for future growth and jobs.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The creation of small businesses by students will be measurable; employment percentages; college and university placement.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The creation of small businesses will be measured by stakeholders including the Chamber of Commerce, the NE Hispanic Chamber Foundation, and the Omaha Public Schools.  We are in the process of networking with local and national organizations and creating a system by which we will measure the outcomes.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Canopy South - assisting with research and data collection, The Omaha Community Playhouse, Omaha Symphony, Omaha Performing Arts and Omaha Conservatory of Music have committed to partnering on events, workshops and programs.  El Museo Latino and Joslyn Art Museum have committed to similar collaborations.  Partnering organizations will increase number of events that they can complete per year (with the new space), which will also spur new job growth for those organizations, plus providing rental income towards financial sustainability.  This also exponentially increases touring opportunities for the South community to showcase their talents in other parts of the region.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The budget for construction is $28m.  The $15m request from the state is vital.  The project was budgeted prior to Covid and the extreme rise in inflation.  Donor dollars in the community are not available due to committments to the Joslyn Art Museum renovation, the Omaha Performing Arts venue, Gene Leahy Mall, the new science museum and new development at UNMC.  The District has committed $7m, which includes a $1m budget for furniture and equipment.  The OPS Foundation has committed $500,000 for the project.  Since there is no land acquisition, the anticipated soft costs of the project are estimated to be $3m-$4m.  The balance of funding will come from private donors.  This project will be an important part of the South Omaha revitalization project and requires funding from the Economic Recovery Act Bill in order to move forward.  We are immensely grateful for your consideration.</p>
