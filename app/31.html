  <p> For 33 years, P4K has provided support and wrap-around services that help Omaha’s promising youth in reach their full-potential, which is our proudest achievement and highest honor. Additional recent achievements of note include:

1. Holland Heroes Award Recipient | In 2019, P4K President/CEO Debbie Denbeck,  received the Holland Children’s Institute Holland Heroes award for our success in youth advancement in the city.

2. Highly Qualified Program Staff | A substantial percentage of the youth who participate in P4K programs represent some of Omaha’s most vulnerable populations. As such, it is critical that our staff is highly trained and well prepared to support youth struggling to overcome past/current trauma, systemic challenges, food/housing insecurities, etc. As such, all P4K direct service staff have been trained in Trauma-Informed Practices, Child Abuse/Neglect Mandatory Reporter training, MENTOR Elements of Effective Practice training and additional continuing education trainings focused on working with diverse youth populations. 

Additionally, P4K maintains one full-time staff member who is a licensed social worker as a qualified resource to oversee and ensure all student case-management work performed aligns with best practice. 

3. DEI Awareness and Advocacy | P4K is a strong community advocate of diversity, equity, and inclusion principles. DEI-focused experiences and education is an integrated part of all program curriculum. into program curriculum. P4K regularly hosts a series of student-led forums focused on promoting DEI initiatives in the community. P4K has a full-time staff member dedicated to leading the agency’s internal and community-wide diversity initiatives, as well as overseeing the agency’s employee-operated diversity and inclusion committee. This committee has been integral in establishing several internal policies to better align P4K with DEI standards of best practice. The committee is also responsible for reviewing all agency messaging and communication to ensure it aligns with DEI standards of best practice. P4K has a library of DEI literature for staff and volunteer access, and annually sponsors one staff member’s participation in a year-long diversity and cultural awareness training program through community organization Inclusive Communities, called LeadDIVERSITY. P4K’s LeadDIVERSITY program graduates have gained exceptional skills training and community connections that continue to facilitate implementation and advancement of P4K’s DEI initiatives. 

4.  The Nebraska Developing Youth Talent Initiative (DYTI) 2020 Grant Recipient Partner | Through this two-year grant, P4K partnered with CLAAS of Omaha to implement programming that engaged P4K middle school students in hands-on exploration of engineering principles and H3 (high demand, high wage, high skill) Nebraska-based careers. 

5. AmeriCorps/AmeriCorps VISTA Approved Service Site | P4K is proud to be an approved service site through an active partnership with the AmeriCorps program that we have maintained for over five years.

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Proposal Overview | Partnership 4 Kids (P4K) respectfully requests funding support implementation of the College and Career Readiness Program (CCRP), from January 2023-June 2026. CCRP is proven successful at engaging youth in their education and preparation for the future and currently serves 538 middle and high school youth from under-resourced communities in North and South Omaha. Programming equips participants with the tools and skills needed to successfully navigate academic transitions, graduate high school, and pursue a post-secondary pathway that leads to professional satisfaction and financial stability. 

CCRP focuses on four key areas of student support: academic persistence, social-emotional wellness, exploration of / planning for post-secondary education, and workforce readiness. Students participate in curriculum-based programming, have access to consistent mentor support, and engage in immersive post-secondary and career exploration experiences, as well as quality summer learning workshops and seminars. P4K program meetings are held after school, two to four times a month in cohorts of 20-25 students who are grade-level peers. These inputs have proven effective at keeping students on-track to graduate high school, and ready for post-secondary education and professional pursuits.

Location | All CCRP interventions are primarily conducted within ten Title I schools from the Omaha Public Schools District in North and South Omaha (McMillan, Monroe, Norris, Lewis and Clark, Marrs, Benson, Central, North, Northwest and South). Of these partner schools, seven lie within the Qualified Census Tract. It is important to note that of program-enrolled students that attend a school outside of the QCT, self-reported data shows 90.5% live within a qualifying zip code and as a result are also being disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

Proposed Project Timeline | 
January – May 2023,- 2026
• Second semester program sessions take place
• Individual case management conducted (monthly average frequency)
• Weekly tutoring (high school level as needed service)

June – July 2023-2025 
• P4K summer programming; career exploration, leadership, and skill building workshops  
• Individual case management conducted
August 2023-2025
• Program evaluation and curriculum design modifications and staff training
September-December 2023-2025
•	First semester program sessions take place
•	Individual case management sessions conducted (monthly average frequency)
•	Weekly tutoring (high school level as needed service)</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Partnership 4 Kids (P4K) is respectfully requesting funding support of CCRP services between January 2023-June 2026. It is important to know that our agency is currently implementing a two-year ARPA-funded intervention plan enhancing CCRP with targeted interventions to address the disproportionately negative impact that CCRP students are experiencing as a result of the pandemic. It should be noted that this intervention plan is intended to be a short-term enhancement of CCRP’s regular programming and services and awarded ARPA funds only cover the costs of pandemic-related interventions, not regular program services. This two-year intervention is slated to conclude July 1, 2024, however, we are acutely aware a percentage of CCRP students will continue to require prolonged interventions such as tutoring services and family outreach. To address this issue, P4K will extend the Tutoring Coordinator employment contract through May 31, 2026.

CCRP offers year-round programming and services. Program sessions implemented during the school year are held after school for 1.5 hours, 2-4 times per month (depending on participant’s grade level). In the summer months students can enroll in one or more leadership and career exploration workshops and opportunities scheduled throughout the months of June and July. On average, each summer workshop consists of 3-5 half-day sessions. A detailed timeline of project milestones taking place during the requested funding period will be included in application attachments and enclosures. While our funding proposal is requesting support for a 3.5-year project period, it is important to note CCRP is an ongoing intervention that will continue to be implemented by P4K well beyond the funding period and for as long as there is a community need for service.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Omaha continues to experience high rates of generational poverty in the city’s Northeast and Southeast communities, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19. The pandemic has ravaged these already under-resourced areas, furthering financial burdens, amplifying inequities, and leaving the youngest residents growing up in these communities with reduced rates of hope about their future.  This lack of hope has contributed to visibly increased rates of academic disengagement. With Omaha Public Schools students’ academic proficiency rates 20 percent below the state average (even lower among the district’s most vulnerable students), and significant declines in school attendance, it is clear that students have lost their academic motivation. Research from the National Center for Biotechnology Information informs us that disengagement is a strong predictor of school dropout and problem behavior trajectories of drug use and crime. What’s more, according to Urbanventures.org, hopelessness is a key factor in continuing cycles of poverty for one generation to the next. “Without hope and the belief that life can be better, the motivation and energy needed to break the cycle are very low,” (urbanventures.org). 

P4K’s College and Career Readiness Program (CCRP) is actively addressing these issues by targeting youth growing up in these communities and implementing critical program interventions that are shifting mindsets, restoring hope and building sustainable pathways out of poverty. 

CCRP exposes participants to a world that exists beyond their daily circumstances, expanding the realm of what is possible and empowering them to pursue it. Throughout program enrollment, CCRP participants visit nearly a dozen college campuses (local and regional) and engage in 15+ career tours and exploration experiences at businesses and organizations throughout the city. These immersive experiences help participants view concepts such as attending college and/or running a company as tangible possibilities for their future, thereby shifting their mindsets from daily survival to future-focused planning.

We know that youth present Omaha’s greatest prospect for community development and sustainability. CCRP staff and volunteers guide young participants with supportive, evidence-based practices that improve their chances for success in academics, post-secondary opportunities, and career readiness. CCRP’s quality curriculum in conjunction with its real-world connections, hands-on experience, and positive role models is richly enhancing the education of vulnerable youth in North and South Omaha, thereby preparing them to become the next generation of Omaha’s educated workforce and strengthening long-term community sustainability.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> CCRP serves students attending school and living in North and South Omaha communities, within qualified census tracts and disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to both North and South Omaha Inventory and Opportunities Memos, unemployment rates are relatively high and poverty rates are persistent. P4K addresses these threats to quality of life by promoting academic persistence and providing opportunities to explore post-secondary pathways leading to financially stable careers. P4K also promotes students’ pursuit of 2-year degrees/certificate programs and maintains a strong partnership with Metropolitan Community College for all program levels, thus increasing the likelihood of more students attending this local college.

Additionally, according to the South Omaha Inventory and Opportunity Memo, the area has a thriving small business community.  The CCRP’s career-focused programming supports the long-term sustainability of this community strength by creating opportunities for students to engage in entrepreneurship and practice the skills necessary for entrepreneurial success, thereby ensuring this vibrant community asset continues to grow. 

An unfortunate threat that was identified within the South Omaha Inventory is the negative perceptions of South Omaha, immigrants, and diversity. P4K works intensively to combat these challenges, particularly with students and their families for whom English is not their native language.  CCRP program staff assist students and their families with navigating potential barriers with post-secondary education enrollment and/or securing financial support, connecting them with free legal support and additional resources as needed. 

Another South Omaha threat identified in the Inventory and Opportunity Memo is “Lack of Behavioral Health Care”. In addition to the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the physical health of South Omaha residents, it has also had a similar effect on the mental and social health of residents, particularly that of youth in the community. There has been a sharp decline in students’ social-emotional skills and an increase in negative behavioral outbursts.  CCRP proactively addresses and prevents future challenges in this space by providing students with social-emotional learning/awareness, facilitating positive peer interactions, and creating strong networks of social support. Equipped with these resources, participants can communicate their needs effectively, resolve conflict and advocate for themselves and others.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> CCRP ensures Omaha juveniles, ages 11-18, who face racial or socioeconomic disparities, are equipped with the resources and motivation to academically persist, actively plan for, and progress toward a future that includes high school graduation, post-secondary education, professional satisfaction, and financial stability. CCRP mentors and staff provide support and guidance that is focused on this purpose, engaging juvenile participants in targeted curriculum and opportunities to explore and prepare for higher education and viable career pathways. 

Additionally, CCRP implements preventive measures that reduce a participant’s likelihood of becoming system-involved. Table A (below) demonstrates the alignment of program interventions with specific contributors to system involvement.
Table A Program Interventions to Combat System Involvement 
Contributors to System Involvement-------> Program Interventions
Violence at Home------->  Case Management and Positive Role Models
Poor Education Quality------->  Tutoring & Individualized Academic Plans
Substance Abuse------->  Wellness Activities & Resources
Peer Pressure------->  Positive Peer Group Interactions
Socioeconomic Factors------->Financial Literacy Curriculum & Emergency Funding

Multiple studies tell us that the pathway to juvenile system-involvement often begins with discipline infractions in the classroom. Elements of programming curriculum (social-emotional learning sessions, self-advocacy, conflict management, and healthy relationships) and individual student case management help prevent and minimize common classroom infractions like truancy and behavior issues which are precursors to the “school to prison pipeline” that is disproportionately represented by juveniles of color.

From the very beginning of their enrollment in CCRP, participants learn strategies to handle conflict, process their own emotions, and balance competing priorities. With time and practice of these strategies, participants develop the persistence and resilience that enable them to improve academic achievement, and school attendance, reducing their risk of dropping out of school and/or system involvement. 

These preventive measures are mitigating the need for costly juvenile confinement facilities that are an economic drain on the community. According to estimates made by the Justice Policy Institute (JPI), it now costs states an average of $214,620 per year to incarcerate one child in their most expensive confinement facilities. Evidence indicates that incarceration is not a working method of reform and, if anything, causes unnecessary expense to the community and inflicts more profound damage on the juvenile involved, and increases their likelihood for recidivism which adds to the already high cost associated with criminal reform. 

Conversely, CCRP is cultivating the seeds of long-lasting economic growth in North and South Omaha by providing vulnerable youth growing up in these communities with the resources, experiences and guidance that facilitate academic success, financial stability and a civic-minded desire to positively contribute to their community that supported their growth and development.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Each year, CCRP positions hundreds of the community’s young people to overcome systemic barriers, household challenges, and trauma-induced behaviors by equipping them with new skills, a network of support and experiences that motivate academic engagement and inspire future-focused mindsets. Many CCRP participants and alumni have informed our staff that prior to their program participation, they did not believe that a post-secondary education was an attainable goal for them.  However, the consistent annual increase in the number of CCRP participants enrolling in post-secondary education programs upon graduation (which continued to persist for over a decade) would suggest otherwise. With access to the proper resources and guidance, it is clear--our students can achieve anything. 

CCRP is reducing equity gaps in North and South Omaha communities by increasing participants’ access to enrichment opportunities and eliminating common barriers to participation. Program staff work tirelessly to ensure these students have the same access to college campuses, networking opportunities, hands-on career experiences, etc. that are readily available to their more affluent peers. 

Through their program participation CCRP students learn and practice skills that will increase their employability, their financial stability and, by extension, the economic stability of their communities. This can be further substantiated by data gleaned from 2019 analysis of program impact that was conducted by Omaha Chamber of Commerce, which determined P4K programs bring increased economic activity to the community.  The Chamber focused on a test group of 37 program graduates who with support and guidance they gained from the program, pursued a post-secondary education earned their degrees and remained in Omaha. The study determined that the city’s annual economic activity was increased by over $500,000 more than if those test subjects had not pursued post-secondary education.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> CCRP is contributing to community sustainability by motivating its young people to obtain education and employment that provides financial stability. By following this path, more young people are breaking community cycles of poverty.  CCRP is reducing equity/opportunity gaps for youth residents of North and South Omaha communities by increasing participants’ access to enrichment experiences and eliminating common barriers to participation. Program staff work tirelessly to ensure these students have the same access to college campuses, networking opportunities, hands-on career experiences, etc. that are readily available to their more affluent peers. 

CCRP is cultivating a pipeline of educated workforce-ready individuals, who will become tomorrow's community leaders.  Through their program participation CCRP students learn and practice skills that will increase their employability, their financial stability and, by extension, the economic stability of their communities. This can be further substantiated by data gleaned from 2019 analysis of program impact that was conducted by Omaha Chamber of Commerce, which determined P4K programs bring increased economic activity to the community.  The Chamber focused on a test group of 37 program graduates who with support and guidance they gained from the program, pursued a post-secondary education earned their degrees and remained in Omaha. The study determined that the city’s annual economic activity was increased by over $500,000 more than if those test subjects had not pursued post-secondary education.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The CCRP is not patterned exclusively after one specific evidence/research-based practice, but rather utilizes multiple sources of evidence-based research on which its varied initiatives are based.  The program’s mentoring model follows the research-based Elements of Effective Practice, endorsed by MENTOR at the national level. These elements include dosage practices, mentor screening and training standards, as well as how to match mentor/mentees and how to initiate mentor/mentee matches. Much of CCRP’s program curriculum is based on components of the Association for Middle Level Education (AMLE).  However, it should be noted that all CCRP career readiness lessons include one or more standards taken from the Nebraska Department of Education Career Readiness Standards. CCRP also uses the evidence-based Clifton Strengths/Gallup Strengths Explorer curriculum to engage participants in identifying their personal assets and how to leverage them for academic and career success.  The program curriculum and design aligns with all seven of the suggested strategies in Preventing Multiple Risky Behaviors among Adolescents: Seven Strategies (childtrends.org)  which are as follows: 1. Support and strengthen family functioning; 2. Increase connections between students and their schools; 3. Make communities safe and supportive for children and youth; 4. Promote involvement in high quality out-of-school-time programs; 5. Promote the development of sustained relationships with caring adults; 6. Provide children and youth opportunities to build social and emotional competence; and 7. Provide children and youth with high quality education during early and middle childhood.  Additionally, program staff track youth participants’ school absences, and uses an evidence-based three-tiered reform system developed by Attendance Works to identify an appropriate level of  intervention. This system has been successfully implemented in organizations, (like GOALS Center, locally) and in districts across the United States (attendanceworks.org/chronic-absence/addressing-chronic-absence/3-tiers-of-intervention/). As part of its holistic approach, CCRP initiatives promote family engagement, which research states “can increase participation in positive health behaviors such as school-related physical activity and improved educational achievement” (youth.gov). CCRP offers opportunities for family engagement such as family curriculum nights, participant recognition events, and regular updates about participants’ program progress via phone, letter, and email.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> CCRP success is defined by both data-driven quantitative analysis and the profound qualitative changes program participants and their families experience. The goal of P4K’s CCRP is to provide all P4K students with the support needed to persist in school, develop a sense of hope for their futures, overcome barriers to academic success, access post-secondary education, complete their degree or certificate programs, and secure careers that offer both financial stability and benefits that elevate them out of poverty. Quantitatively, P4K has established rigorous outcome measurements and analysis for defining program success. Key success indicators include: •	75% of students earn a C or above in math and English each semester •	95% of students miss less than nine days of school per year •	85% of students persist in P4K annually •	90% of students report having a caring adult in their life in addition to their parent / guardian •	100% of students can identify a career interest by the end of middle school •	100% of students have completed their Gallup Strengths Explorer Assessment by the end of middle school •	90% of students complete a Career Cluster Survey by the end of 10th grade •	100% of students can identify their educational pathway for their career of interest by the end of 10th grade •	70% of students will have a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher •	85% of students complete one scholarship application in addition to the P4K Scholarship by the end of 12th grade •	90% of graduating high school seniors enroll in a post-secondary program •	95% of students graduate high school</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Program staff monitor participants’ academic progress/success to ensure program strategies are having the theorized impact. These outcome measurements include participants’ demographic data, attendance, state test scores, GPA, high school graduation rate, and progress in developing a post-secondary plan with personalized goals for success. Qualitatively, CCRP students, families, and mentors are asked for personal feedback in the form of an annual program satisfaction survey. All aforementioned data is compiled into a comprehensive annual evaluation of programs and services.  This annual agency evaluation is compiled by the agency’s internal curriculum and evaluation department, consisting of a Director of Program Operations and Program Planning and Impact VISTA member. In addition to internal evaluation, Partnership 4 Kids partners with the University of Nebraska Omaha STEPs (Support and Training for the Evaluation of Programs) to provide outside perspective and develop logic models and measures for all levels of programming.  Evaluation results are shared publicly through an annual report.</p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> While Partnership 4 Kids administrative office is located at 1004 Farnam Street, Omaha NE 68102, it is important to note that all CCRP activities and services (with exception of off-site tours/exploration experiences) will take place at ten partner schools within the Omaha Public Schools District. All ten schools are Title I qualified and are located within in Northeast and Southeast Omaha.
Seven of ten CCRP partner schools lie within the Qualified Census Tract (QCT). Of CCRP students attending a partner school outside of the QCT, self-reported data shows 90.5% live within a qualifying zip code. Beyond geographic location, additional data confirms CCRP participants are enduring circumstances that put them at a greater risk of dropping out of school and continuing cycles of generational poverty and resource disparity. Over 85% of CCRP participants represent ethnic minorities which Nebraska incarcerates at rates well above the national rate (Cordes, Mar. 6, 2022, omaha.com). Additionally, the vast majority of CCRP participants are growing up in poverty. Based on self-reported data from the families of the CCRP students, the median income range is between $15k-$25k, and according to free and reduced lunch data provided by the OPS district, 81% of CCRP participants are free-and-reduced-lunch qualified.

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Partnership 4 Kids is respectfully requesting $ 2376,800.00 to support CCRP services and interventions implemented during the period of Jan. 1, 2023-Jun. 30 2026.  This request amount is the projected cost for program inputs (staff, supplies, program evaluation, administrative costs, etc.) that are necessary to achieve desired participant/community impact, minus any funding that has already been secured and allocated to CCRP for this time period.
Our assertion that our program cost is reasonable is based on the assessment of Impact Genome Project (impactgenome.org). CCRP inputs, and outcomes are annually evaluated by Impact Genome Registry, a repository of impact data on over 2.2 million nonprofits and social programs across the U.S. According to the most Impact Genome evaluation of CCRP which took place in November of 2021, our program’s cost is in line with the average cost range of all programs within the Impact Genome database targeting similar outcomes. 

Additionally, it is worth noting that P4K maintains excellent internal controls, overseen by an active board committee and managed by the agency’s CFO. With their leadership and guidance, P4K has seen an increase in federal, state and local grant funding over the past three years.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Grant funds will be used to directly support youth/young adult programming that transforms lives for generations to come. CCRP is designed to empower young people growing up in North and South Omaha communities to obtain an education and the skills required to be competitive candidates as they enter the workforce. To that end, CCRP provides participants with access to opportunities, resources and guidance to be successful in their pursuits. Grant funds will be specifically allocated toward the two most critical program inputs required to produce desired outcomes are staffing and program experiences.
Staffing |Maintaining sufficient staff who are highly qualified, experienced, and committed to the agency mission is critical for project success and long-term sustainability. Primary expenses associated with this input include salaries and benefits.  This line item includes the total salary/benefits cost of all direct service staff who allocate one hundred percent of their time to CCRP program efforts. Additionally, a portion of salary and benefits costs of curriculum and evaluation staff, volunteer recruitment staff and administrative staff is figured into this expense at the rate of their time that is allocated toward CCRP.
Program Experiences |Equally critical for achieving desired program impact/participant outcomes are the program experiences participants are invited to engage in. National research supports that the greatest barriers perpetuating the chronic achievement gap for students from low-income households is access to quality, out-of-school learning To ensure these initiatives are successful, experiences must impart targeted lessons/skills identified in the design of the program, they must accommodate common barriers to participation by providing  participants with safe transportation, nourishment (snack/meal), supplies necessary to engage in the activity, and they must prompt desire to participate. Additionally, to maintain continued program persistence, incentivizing attendance or rewarding participation with a token of recognition is also important. As such expenses such as bus/van rentals, mileage, snacks, supplies/materials, etc. are included into this line item.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Partnership 4 Kids is well-positioned to sustain the CCRP far beyond the grant period due to the financial and program development strategies which we are currently putting in place. Currently, P4K is a Type I supporting organization of the Omaha Community Foundation under section 509(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. We are completing eligibility requirements for becoming an independent 501(c)(3), which we anticipate will be submitted and approved by the end of 2022.  This status will increase our eligibility to apply for additional funding opportunities, strengthening our agency’s financial sustainability. P4K’s executive board is also developing new fundraising campaigns to increase revenue.  Partnership 4 Kids has long-standing relationships with major corporations throughout Omaha that provide agency programs with financial support, mentor volunteers, career exploration opportunities, student internships, and professional experiences. Additionally, we project the outstanding participant outcomes that CCRP initiatives yield such as a 95% high school graduation rate and a 90% post-secondary enrollment rate will attract additional funding support. Additionally, as a future-focused organization, Partnership 4 Kids will remain committed to amplifying our financial assets by consistently increasing the number of grant requests submitted, unique supporters secured, and fundraising campaigns implemented annually.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> P4K works aggressively to secure grants from private foundations and corporations, making up the bulk of our annual revenue. Our agency remains committed to ensuring no fees are charged to students or families for participation. In addition to soliciting funding support from private foundations, and corporations, P4K also actively seeks out federal and state funding opportunities that align with program objectives. P4K currently receives funding and volunteer support through an ongoing partnership with AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps members are critical to the success of the CCRP, enabling increased program impact. Other revenue sources include general donations, in-kind gifts, and a percentage of funds secured through events and fundraising campaigns. Burlington Capital provides a significant in-kind contribution for rent and utilities (secured) while post-secondary institutions, companies, etc. support student programming with transportation, meals, and other expenses (estimated pending based on historical in-kind revenue).

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> While our ability to effectively implement CCRP’s quality services and programming depends on the financial contributions of our agency supporters, it should be noted that P4K also receives funding gifts that are unrestricted, and these gifts could be re-allocated to CCRP if necessary.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> As previously mentioned in the timeline section of this application, P4K’s CCRP is an ongoing intervention that will extend beyond the funding period of this proposal, and for aP4K’s College and Career Readiness Program; however, it is worth noting that through implementation of this program that we hope to make a significant economic impact on the North and South Omaha communities. Additionally, we intend to expand our programming areas to include more schools in South Omaha. With time and increased funding, we will be able to serve a larger population of Omaha’s youth.  For 33 years P4K has proudly provided programming and services for low-income students in the Omaha Public Schools District, because it has such a high rate of need for support. We are exceptionally proud of the impact that our programming has made (and continues to make) within this target demographic, and we are fiercely committed to providing programming and services within this geographic service area for as long as there is a need.  However, we are also acutely aware that the need for program interventions such as ours is expands far beyond the number of youth our funding allows us capacity to serve. With time and increased funding, scaling up the number of schools and students or programming and services reach is possible.  Conversely, scaling down the capacity of youth with access to CCRP programming and services would be ill-advised as currently enrolled CCRP participants have come to depend on the support, services and access to opportunities CCRP participation affords them, and eliminating these services without providing alternate resources puts them at risk for reverting to risky behaviors, system involvement and undoing all the progress they have been able to make through program participation.</p>
