  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Research shows that business has declined in North Omaha and low-income residents, especially those in the QCT area have suffered tremendously. In order to restore business to the community and help QCT area residents to recover, North Omaha will need a central strategic location to attract business in order for the community to remain competitive. The Carnation Ballroom building which sits empty has been the business and social building for North Omaha families and is a valuable part of the cultural heritage and business community, and sits in the corridor of the business district.  If renovated, and equipped with a key acitive and live business, it can return vibrancy to North Omaha. The Carnation building and its location is essential to North Omaha and its people's ability to transform, have a place to create jobs, provide job readiness, and provide generational wealth for generations to come.

The proposal is for the immediate purchase of the building and renovation and program support for NCODE live interactive program. The program will attract and accelerate business growth, serve as a place for job creation and job readiness and entrepreneurship training participation for North Omaha and QCT area residents. Currently the Carnation building sits ready to renovate and has been designated as a local City of Omaha Landmark but now sits in disrepair. The owner has agreed to sale and has a real estate agent.

NCODE would like to assist North Omaha deserving populations to recover from the social and economic harms of the pandemic and revive business opportunity and entrepreneurship to and in the North Omaha commercial district. NCODE's program is a magnet to attract business activity and by functioning within the renovated Carnation building as a live-interactive business, it will not only transform the lives of underserved residents, but will spur local and nationwide business interest and investment growth in North Omaha.  This activity will increase traffic flow to the 24th street business district and attract visitors to its nearby shops, companies, and increase market for more businesses and  entrepreneurs to open in North Omaha. This combination of renovation and NCODE's program is a win-win for North Omaha, Omaha, and Nebraska.
