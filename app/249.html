  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 83000000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 50000000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Nonprofits are currently often run based on the needs or demands of its primary donors, and this creates a power imbalance in our communities as the needs of the community members are not being centered or prioritized. In order to create a more equitable philanthropic sector, we need to create a system that takes information from our community members and filters it to the nonprofits to show how the nonprofit is responding directly to the needs of its clients. This system would give more power to communities and be a way for communities to come together to decide how philanthropists or nonprofits can best respond to the needs of these areas. 
This new structure would hire individuals who are living within these communities that would then be responsible for local organizing and community engagement efforts. We would work with an anti-racist data company that could develop a methodology around how we could best collect data from individuals, and that could then be filtered directly to nonprofits. Nonprofits could then use this data to determine what services they offer to respond to the community’s needs, and to display to philanthropists why they need funding towards their efforts. 
This system would be a harm reduction methodology, as philanthropists who are not a part of these communities would not determine what is best for these communities to prosper or thrive.
Once set up, this new structure could also serve as a basis for a participatory budgeting program within our city, as there would be a structure set up for organizing community members and having most (if not everyone’s) voice as a part of the conversation.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> The entirety of 2023 would be spent building out data systems, collecting information from nonprofit groups, building relationships with philanthropists, and navigating how this program could best support these community members and the city at large. 2024 would be hiring and onboarding, doing trainings with these hired community members, and doing data collection with their nearby community members. 2025 and 2026 would be determined based on what these communities dictate and how this new structure can based respond to those articulated needs</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal will directly respond to the community members articulated needs. It is a way for information to be more directly articulated to the nonprofit sector, philanthropists, and the City of Omaha. This will create a better quality of life, as they community members will have a more direct way to communicate with power systems. This could hopefully influence future policy decisions, and how our city overall is run.</p>
