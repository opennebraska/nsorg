  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> True Purpose, established in 2021, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Omaha, Nebraska. True Purpose's goal is to provide opportunities and resources to individuals and families in transition in order to help them grow toward a meaningful future by following a methodical path to success. Tyrece and Tashiara Wilson moved their family to Omaha in 2015 after trying to find their place in Kansas City. The founders were penniless, befuddled, and seeking for a new purpose for themselves and their family after spending three decades in the criminal underworld of the inner city. Two years later, the founders, Tye and Tashiara Wilsons, accepted three homeless persons into their home and embraced them as family. Through self-reflection and experiences, the Wilsons were able to see their own patterns of fleeting escape and ongoing pain, allowing them to provide struggling individuals with a clear perspective on homelessness and come to the realization that the ability to focus on one's own well-being is the key to making long-term improvements in one's life. As a consequence, the organization is built on the beliefs and findings of the most basic practical needs, such as providing food and shelter, before focusing on their mental, spiritual, and physical rehabilitation. The Wilsons envision a flourishing community filled with opportunities for people of all ages and backgrounds to reach their full potential and pursue careers based on a servant leadership model and a faith-based value system. The organization thinks that a person is living their life with real purpose when they live it with true purpose and strive tirelessly to improve the lives of others in their community, one person at a time. The effort involves the construction of low-cost homes in many places around Omaha, as well as aid in acquiring basic life skills and placement in acceptable employment.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> True Purpose will be guided by the outcomes of the Visioning Workshop, which was conducted with community stakeholders from North and South Omaha. To further understand the needs and ambitions of the communities, the Project Team convened an LB1024 Visioning Workshop with community stakeholders from both North and South Omaha. These workshops were designed to elicit meaningful feedback from community stakeholders such as business owners, faith-based organizations, service providers, real estate specialists, and government authorities. Their contributions and by-products will be minority-led, minority-driven attitudes that will provide BIPOC persons with access to programs and services that will lead to sustainable living and employment, as well as long-term facilitation.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Housing and homelessness are among the strategic goals of LB1024, as are community and small business recovery, community well-being, and community assistance and programming. True Purpose continues to promote all of these in the North and South Omaha communities. True Purpose exists to provide creation in affordable housing, life skills coaching, and job placement assistance to people who have experienced the greatest adversity in their lives. Thus, True Purpose combats racial inequity by providing participants with clear routes to achievement. The group believes that genuine life change occurs when all members of society are given equal opportunity. True Purpose offers men and women a "reset" inside a collaborative and renewal-centered atmosphere by addressing their basic needs and enabling them to focus their energy on healing, conquering, and creating a vision for the future. The group believes that community empowerment starts with one person. To really oppose injustice and advocate for racial equity, organizations must reach out to individuals at all stages of life and extend an invitation to something more, understanding that personal change is the cornerstone for community development and empowerment. The following is a summary of our resource values</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> True Purpose's primary goal is to create a community that will live, work, and thrive in the areas identified in this grant. Thus, the economic impact of True Purpose will be greatly impactful in the Omaha community. The organization believes in developing leaders who will become renegotiating authority champions in order to promote minority business owners such as African Americans and other multicultural groups. This is known as community empowerment, and it occurs when all members of the community have access to the same resources. True Purpose will first build the infrastructure and then train the individuals in the community through newly constructed programs and services, including those currently under construction. Economic impact will occur when there is a path to a solution to promote community empowerment by investigating social, cultural, political, and economic factors to improve the community's health and wealth. This is known as economic resilience and the goals, strategies, and actions that can mitigate the effects of an economic incident such as income inequality and Covid-19 recovery to support long-term recovery efforts of success.</p>

Small business owners  and businesses in the Qualified Census Tracts ( QCT), such as the projected coffee shop, would prioritize employee engagement and recruiting in the OCT areas listed in this initiative. Contractors, merchants, and suppliers will also visit the OCT areas listed.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Important social connection and participation. This is achieved by enlisting a large number of community partners to urge individuals to seek assistance.

  <p> How will this incorporate best/proven practices or demonstrate innovation (e.g., bringing new concepts to Omaha, etc.)?= True Purpose will emphasize New Urbanism as a planning and development concept by giving minority groups in North and South Omaha a voice and the ability to design their own communities.  See attachment with timline This means introducing new ideas to Omaha that have previously been unavailable to these minority, immigrant, and refugee groups.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> True Purpose will use our four values to measure outcomes. This will in turn allow True Purpose to continue its mission to promote increased education, resulting in the creation of new high-wage employment possibilities, housing, workforce development, and promote social and economic equality. COMMUNITY We prioritize true connection with our community and choose to welcome individuals who have a different worldview than ourselves.

We think that everyone deserves a place at the table and that individual and collective tenacity are necessary for lasting life improvement.   COMMITMENT  We are committed to creating innovative materials that help individuals transition from striving to purpose.  COMPASSION Everything, we do is founded on compassion, caring, and connection.</p>
