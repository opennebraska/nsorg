  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> 	We moved to our Sorensen location in 2010 during the Recession of 2009-2010.  This newer facility offered us a larger, updated building with limited indoor training space.  In 2012, our Training Director, Doug Sea was an adjunct instructor at Metro Community College providing Weatherization training for the Nebraska Energy Office (NEO).  We were then approached by NEO to use our facility and partner directly with NEO on Weatherization training.  In 2016, after a vigorous application process, we became the only Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) accredited facility in the Midwest.  Through this accreditation we were able to offer a high level of Weatherization training to the State of Nebraska and the eight Community Action agencies that perform the weatherization processes.  This also allowed us to facilitate accredited training for the City of Omaha with various weatherization projects and incentives that were available.
	We recruit and train a diverse workforce to assist contractors in meeting diversity goals.  The following are examples of projects in which we assisted contractors in meeting diversity goals set either by the project owner or Corp of Engineers:
1.	STRATCOM at Offutt Airforce Base
2.	Martin Marietta Tunnel Project
3.	OPPD’s Fort Calhoun Plant Protection and Flood Repairs
4.	Google and other area data centers
5.	Numerous wind farm projects</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Contractors – Laborers Training Fund is looking to expand training opportunities for more residents of North and South Omaha.  By expanding our training facility, it will not only allow us to increase our training capacity but allow us to offer more year-round, in-depth, hands-on training experience for these residents.  The expansion of our current facility will allow us to bring in and train more apprentices, expand training curriculum for current construction workers, and train workers in new construction technologies that will aid contractors at this critical time.

The Expansion of the Contractors – Laborers Training Facility will provide training for individuals for jobs that are currently open as well as future openings for upcoming projects, such as, Mutual of Omaha’s new headquarters, Project NExT, gas and water line replacement with Metropolitan Utilities District and hundreds of other projects slated to start in the next 2-5 years.  These jobs are family supporting careers that make up to $35 per hour.  These jobs include health insurance and retirement benefits for the worker and their dependents.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Our projected timeline would be to begin construction on the expansion of our building as soon as funds are received.  We believe construction will last 9-12 months, weather permitting.  We believe the expansion will be 100% completed by July of 2025.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal to expand our current facility will allow us to increase not just the number of Omaha residents we train, but the type of training we are able to offer them.  

The expanded facility will have a hands-on lab area on the north side of the current building that will allow for year-round training and classrooms added onto the east side.  The classrooms will serve as learning spaces and computer labs.

The following will be training done in the hands-on lab:

•	Concrete Site Prep
•	Aerial Lifts
•	Construction Math Applications
•	Concrete Placement
•	Computer Classes 
•	10 & 30 Hour OSHA Courses
•	Pipeline Safety
•	Trenching, Shoring and Laser Set Up
•	Mason Tending
•	Scaffolding Types Taught:
	Mason Walk Through
	Mason Square
	Tube and Clamp
	Systems
•	Cutting Torch
•	Arc Welding
•	Hoisting and Rigging
•	Crane Signaling
•	Rough Terrain Forklift
•	Blueprint Reading
•	Elevation Control – Building/Sitework
•	Line and Grade
•	Skid-Steer Loader Operation & Maintenance
•	Mock ICRA Area for Hospital Renovation Training
•	EPA Lead Remediation and Safe Removal

The type of long term, sustainable training we provide, will give the residents of Omaha the opportunity to begin a career in the construction industry.  This career will transform their quality of life by providing them a living wage with yearly increases, health insurance for themselves and immediate family members and a healthy, pension plan that offers security in their retirement.  Persons making a living wage can afford good housing and upkeep of their residence, can have an increased economic benefit to their community and area businesses, and live with a sense of security that their needs are met.  

Our facility is a stop on the Omaha bus line, and we have also assisted with travel expenses for training.  The type of training we offer will allow for a more skilled construction workforce which will help with having quality infrastructure and safer jobsites.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> 	It's been said that infrastructure is the foundation upon which a strong economy rests. We believe that and the Visioning Workshop findings to be true. And yet, here in Omaha, we have insufficient infrastructure - both in terms of our physical infrastructure and in terms of the human infrastructure needed to support a thriving economy. Part of the problem is that too many of our citizens lack access to well-paying careers that would allow them to build generational wealth and invest in our community. That's why this proposal is so important. It will directly impact between 75 and 100 individuals per year by training them for good-paying jobs and putting them on a jobsite in as little as a week. These are family-supporting careers that pay up to $36-an-hour, with health insurance and retirement packages included. This is an investment in our future - one that will pay dividends for generations to come. 

When it comes to the cultural context of development, we're proud of the work we've done in recruiting and training a diverse workforce to assist local contractors in meeting their diversity goals. The decimation of the manufacturing base in urban centers has weakened the cultural strength of those communities, including North and South Omaha. An energized, optimistic community creates energized, optimistic leaders. When manufacturing was shifted to the south and the suburbs, the blue collar core of our community was gutted. Higher employment in the urban core means jobs. Restoring these upper-middle class jobs to the urban core means customers for our neighborhood businesses and the kind of disposable income that invests in culture and community. Creating good jobs is essential to reviving our community and providing the support base for a vibrant, cultural area.

Our proposal will help the community access well-paying, in-demand careers rapidly. This will help members of the community develop self-sufficiency and be less reliant on service providers. We are often called upon to help people impacted by the criminal justice system, and others who have been previously excluded, pursue these careers while also accessing resources that were previously unavailable to them. Our proposal will provide employment for members of the community, and in doing so, help to build a stronger, more prosperous community.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The opportunities for the North and South Omaha residents will be transformational by providing a living wage, health, dental and vision insurance, and a well-funded pension plan which can fundamentally change their lifestyle and the community they live in, as well as continuous, long lasting economic growth.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> 	The actual construction will provide 15-20 temporary jobs with a wage of up to $60/hour.  Once the additions to the facility are completed, we will be able to train an additional 75-100 individuals per year, which will lead to 75-100 permanent jobs each year.  Our training opportunities will increase by 100% with these building additions.  Once residents do their initial training of up to 40-80 hours, they are placed with a contractor to learn on the job.  Our Apprenticeship program is set up as an earn while you learn program at no cost to the trainee.  Our earn while you learn program has the apprentice doing 288 in the classroom hours and 3600 on the job hours in a 2-year span. 
	We will be providing and maintaining long lasting educational opportunities for residents of North and South Omaha.  These training opportunities will lead to a good career that provides a living wage, health insurance for the Laborer and their immediate family, and a defined benefits pension plan. 
	Job wage levels - 1st year apprentices earn 90% of our Journeyworker rate.  2nd year apprentices earn 95% of our Journeyworker rate.  Once they have completed their required classroom and on the job hours in 2 years, they will graduate at full Journeyworker scale.</p>

  <p> The individuals we train will be prepared to start employment with businesses/contractors as soon as their initial 40-80 hours of training. A trained and educated worker will benefit businesses and contractors by completing jobs and tasks quicker and safer</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The community will benefit from its community members making a living wage.  Residents will be able to afford housing and the upkeep and maintenance of their property.  They will spend their money at local businesses which could lead to less businesses closing, higher revenues for local businesses and increased jobs due to businesses having increased sales at their business.  Another positive effect of a living wage is peace of mind.  Residents will feel security in knowing they have the ability to pay their bills and have money in their pocket.  Community members with good insurance will be less likely to put off seeing the doctor regarding health concerns, which leads to a healthier community.</p>
