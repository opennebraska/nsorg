  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The North Freeway cut through much of North Omaha in the late 20th century, against the wishes of the residents of the neighborhood, and led to the demolition of 2,000 buildings in the neighborhood, cutting it in 2. Originally intended to link up with I-680 past Florence, construction on it was stopped once it reached Florence, and now mainly exists as a little stub freeway with only 3 exits. Traffic data from the city of Omaha shows that is is underused as well. Furthermore, air quality data from your organization shows that air quality around the North Freeway is lower than elsewhere in the city, leading to higher risks of asthma and COPD. I believe that a modern boulevard with good transit could easily carry the traffic currently handled by the north freeway, while taking up less space, allowing more space for transit oriented affordable housing to spring up.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Rochester, NY took approximately 3 years to complete a tear down and rebuild of .7 miles of an urban freeway.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 0.5</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> By focusing on new transit opportunities and distributing traffic more evenly through the neighborhood, air quality can improve leading to better health for residents. Furthermore, because a boulevard would take up less space than the North Freeway, freed up land can be used to develop affordable housing or park space for residents. And by restoring street connections with the grid, the neighborhood can be more walkable. It also could help revive the 24th/Lake Business District because there would be slower local traffic in the area rather than just funneling every car rapidly out of the neighborhood.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Urban freeways are bad for air quality and health. Furthermore, by restoring the street grid that the North Freeway cleaved in two, you can improve walkability and transit accessibility. Removing the North Freeway would be absolutely transformative for North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> It would be a significant economic opportunity for North Omaha by making it a more walkable, more transit friendly neighborhood.</p>
