  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> This proposal will impact the North and South Omaha Community by providing 100% of the cost for the replacement of deteriorated sidewalks within the frontage of residents' homes and the city right of ways. This program's objective is to create a safer, cleaner, and more walkable community. By creating safe sidewalks, community members will walk on the sidewalk, and not in the streets, to keep the community safe.

VIP Contracting LLC is committed to helping maintain the beauty of our community. As part of this commitment, VIP Contracting LLC provides funds through the 100% Sidewalk Replacement Assistance Program to help residents replace deteriorated sidewalks, and/or curbs and gutters. 

With the great help of LB1024 and its creators, VIP Contracting LLC will replace sidewalks of property owners at 100% the cost. Funding is limited and assistance is provided on a first come, first-serve basis.

Location will be based on applications received and outreach to homeowners in the community.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Safe sidewalks keep people in the community on the sidewalks and out of the streets, which keeps individuals safe. This proposal addresses the needs of trip hazards, damaged and cracked sidewalks, and lack of sidewalks. 2</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Creating safe sidewalks impacts the community directly because it improves individual property. This will then improve property value. Improved property values improves the community as a whole. Creating a safe community for persons to maneuver in improves the community as a whole - from a person who is disabled and uses a wheelchair, to the parents walking their child in a stroller, to the person riding their bike to work. People who are disabled in the community especially need safe sidewalks to be able to navigate their community.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Not only do safe sidewalks impact the people in the community, they will help to create jobs for residents in the community. As the sidewalks are being improved, the workforce to do this will come from people who are from the North Omaha community.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> temporary and permanent jobs will be created.</p>
