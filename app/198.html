  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> We are a moderately new company. Our goal is to decrease minority health disparity through education, equitable resources and clinician outreach. Our slogan is Understand, learn, Improve, Vitality, and Equity (uLIVE).  Lack of representation and limited health care options, significantly affects minorities and is more concerning for female minority Veterans. We have chosen the female Veteran population for our pilot program. Our goal is too provide housing, medical needs, transportation and exercise. To provide a community equivalent to assisted living in other communities, we have purchased and renovated our business at 6223 Florence BLVD. This home will house a minimum of four residents. We plan to add properties in the same area to create stable North Omaha housing for the aging and Veterans within the community.  Victory Psalms Home I, is the first phase of addressing health care disparities in the Omaha minority population. We are registered with System for Award Management (SAM) for government contracting. 
The Omaha economic recovery act proposal/grant will provide us with the opportunity to meet our short term goals of acquiring properties for housing.  As we expand our population focus we plan to add similar assisted living housing within North Omaha, mobile community medicine, and education.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Victory Psalmsâ€™ focus is achieving health equity for minorities and individuals who have served in the Armed Forces. Historically, minorities have been negatively impacted due to health care disparities. The same health disparities are experienced by those who have enlisted in the military.  Many individuals with in the North Omaha community continue to face health disparities that lead to shortened life expand, increased use of healthcare dollars, and premature death. To make in impact in the population, Victory Psalms is targeting minorities who have served in the Armed Forces. A home at 6223 Florence BLVD has been purchased and renovated for assisted living. Bi-weekly planning meetings are held with staff. We are registered with government contracting (SAM). Our goal is to use the Veteran experience from this first Victory Psalms I project and apply the process throughout North Omaha. We are planning for existing home and undeveloped land acquisition. The properties will be used to allow people from the community to stay in the community through times of declining health. Long term, we are planning to acquire undeveloped land from the municipal land bank . On the land we will develop a 20 bedroom assisted living facility. This will create homes for seniors who are not in need of nursing home care but need some assistance to remain independent. It will also create jobs for caregivers, & CNAs allowing them job training with us and then work in the community they live in. We have and will continue to use contractors, such as Black Power Redevelopers LLC and Jackson Concrete. We are planning for a mobile medical unit to service homeless Veterans and others in the North Omaha vicinity. We are hoping to purchase real estate on No 24th street to establish a North Omaha VFW focused on those who enlisted as well as those who may have received unfair discharges. Receiving North Omaha ARPA funds will give our business the competitive edge needed to purchase the properties needed to make an impact in minority health. We believe in our mission and started with our personal funds. We started in the Fall of 2019, with slow progress due to COVID and the significant economy changes that followed. Many of our minority seniors our those who lost their generational family homes during COVID and may be pushed out of the community. We aim to provide education, housing and healthcare to this population.</p>
