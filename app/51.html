  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> This proposal outlines a capital project and expands - Project Houseworks’ existing Home Affordability Program, including workforce development programming. The attached organizational chart reflects Project Houseworks’ existing and proposed programs:

*Home Affordability Program (HAP) provides affordable housing opportunities for low-to-middle income (LMI) persons and families that are looking to achieve the dream of home ownership. We contribute to affordable housing stock by selling single-family homes to LMI homebuyers (120% AMI and below) with down-payment assistance designed to help homebuyers avoid housing cost burden. The existing program uses a purchase-rehabilitation-resale (PRR) model and will be referred to as “HAP-PRR ”. HAP-New Construction is proposed herein and will use a similar affordability model for low-to-moderate income homebuyers to purchase new construction homes.


*Senior Repair Program (existing) provide no-cost solutions to help senior homeowners (age 60+) living at or below 50% of the area median income (AMI) stay in warm, healthy homes, by providing free critical plumbing and electrical repairs, roof replacements, HVAC, tub-to-shower conversions, grab bars, ramps, flooring repair, and other modifications that assist seniors with aging-in-place, mobility, and safety. 


The organizational chart illustrates how the Executive Director oversees the programming. The Executive Director provides reports to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and leads strategic planning utilizing evaluation data. 

The Director of Operations liaises with the Construction Teams and is responsible for ensuring that construction activities follow agreed upon timelines and budgets. This position also oversees Project Houseworks’ workforce development programming. 

Construction Managers provide project management for Senior Repair Program, HAP-PRR and HAP-New Construction which is a proposed position. Each oversees construction crews for their projects. They are responsible for ensuring safety, maintaining schedules, upholding quality of work, and adhering to budget on each project. Each maintains data quality input into BuilderTrend project management software. Each Construction Manager is responsible for approval of their program’s subcontractor bills and for review and response to any warranty repair requests. The HAP construction staff works onsite with interns that are in the workforce development programming.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Project Houseworks, a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, has been working to preserve metro Omaha’s quality affordable housing stock since 1995, when owner-occupied repair work began under Christmas in April Omaha. To date, nearly 3,000 senior-owned homes have been repaired. In 2002, Project Houseworks evolved to join Rebuilding Together, where Project Houseworks remained affiliated until 2018, when Project Houseworks became Project Houseworks.  

Project Houseworks acquired affordable housing rental units in 2015 with a house donated by Wells Fargo Bank that we renovated for rental to a family with income at or below 80% AMI. Additional funding from Wells Fargo Bank and the City of Omaha’s Rental Rehab Program allowed us to make deep renovations ($75,000). To further test this model, we also purchased a fully occupied four-plex with a capacity building grant from the Gary and Mary West Foundation, which required less renovation costs ($20,000). The rental units have since been sold, as our rental property experience helped us identify the high need for affordable homeownership in Douglas and Sarpy Counties. 

To continue the path of this natural progression of our affordable housing activities, Project Houseworks’ Board of Directors authorized PRRs for LMI persons/families, beginning with those with incomes at or below 80% AMI. In 2019-2020, Project Houseworks piloted a program with the City Planning Department using HUD HOME dollars to acquire and rehabilitate 4 single-family homes east of 72nd Street. The properties were purchased by families at or below 80% Area Median Income (AMI), qualifying through the City’s homebuyer financing program. Piloting the program revealed potential for playing a key role in our community's preservation of existing affordable housing stock. All four sold in 2020, helping families at or below 80% AMI achieve their dreams of homeownership and helping protect 3 neighborhoods from blight (two of the homes were side-by-side, which actually allowed us to make a more intense impact in protecting that neighborhood from blight). The City of Omaha doubled funding available for 2021 by providing funding 8 homes and continues to provide funding for our program. In 2021 we transitioned the pilot to our core programming under the name Home Affordability Program relying on outside general contractors and had no dedicated internal construction team. In 2022, Project Houseworks received funding to build capacity to self-perform more PRR activities with a general contractor on staff and to add a dedicated in-house team of construction professionals. In 2022 we will complete ten homes under the PRR model. 

In September 2022, we received a Nebraska Affordable Housing Trust Fund award for PRR of 9 single-family homes to be used over three years. This new funding will allow Project Houseworks to expand its services to homebuyers at or below 120% AMI. In addition, a technical assistance grant from Nebraska Affordable Housing Trust Fund is funding exploration of financial institution products, CDFI possibilities, and other forms of homebuyer assistance, particularly to address the gap of products available for homebuyers between 80-120% AMI as Project Houseworks expands its supportive services

Project Houseworks’ experience with nearly 3,000 owner-occupied rehab repair projects has solidified our reputation as a compassionate, reliable, and quality developer of affordable housing in the Omaha community. Our Senior Repair Program served 168 low-income senior homeowners with free home repairs and modifications in 2021.

In 2021 we began working closely with Latino Center of the Midlands to provide workforce development opportunities to youths through their Siembra Construccion program. We piloted the program in Summer of 2022 with two interns and will expand to eight in 2023. We are now also working with Bryan High School. Our Director of Operations sits on the Advisory Board for their Design and Construction Academy.</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Project Houseworks’ economic recovery response to the COVID-19 pandemic targets the resultant affordable housing crisis. By expanding programming the organization already has in place, Project Houseworks can accelerate plans from its existing 2022-2024 Business Plan. Strategies:

1. expand Home Affordability Program to connect more LMI homebuyers with quality affordable homeownership by adding new construction to the existing PRR model;

2. expand Workforce Development Program by adding staffing capacity to serve more youths and work with partners like  Bryan High School and  Latino Center of the Midlands  to use Home Affordability Program sites for paid construction internships/work experiences; 

3. expand Project Houseworks’ infrastructure and enhance a QCT site with new facilities to house staff, vehicle fleet, tools/supplies, and community resources.

4. expand Senior Repair Program’s free owner-occupied repairs model by extending services to immigrants and refugees (under separated funding).

5. expand supportive services to homeowners and homebuyers. including but not limited to, homebuyer and financial education and assistance, legal assistance, et al .

Locations are prioritized by Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) in Douglas and Sarpy Counties, market availability, and feasibility. Homebuyers must be 120% AMI or below, present a certificate of completion of 8+ hours of HUD-approved homebuyer counseling education, and meet lender approval requirements. QCTs contain 50% of properties slated for resale in 2022 and it is anticipated that this pattern will continue.

A detailed timeline shows all funds expended by July 2026. By the end of Y1, ten affordable housing units will be sold to LMI homebuyers who have completed homebuyer counseling education and 8 interns will participate in paid construction work experiences. Under separate funding, 165 low-income homeowners will receive free home repairs/modifications; Y2 we will sell 14 affordable housing units and provide 14 paid construction internships; while 165 low-income homeowners will receive free home repairs under non LB1024 funding.  Y3 we will sell 24 affordable housing units ; provide 20 paid construction internships; and complete the renovation of new facilities and community space for Project Houseworks affordable housing and workforce development activities. Under separate funding in Y3 we will serve 200 low-income homeowners with free home repairs/modifications.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The development of affordable housing is an eligible use identified in the ARPA Final Rule and aligns with LB1024’s priority for transformational, fundamental change and long-lasting economic growth. The City of Omaha’s draft Housing Affordability Action Plan that was released for public comment on 09/23/2022 identified the spotlight that the COVID-19 pandemic put on the struggles households faced in affording secure, stable housing (p. 10). Project Houseworks’ proposal responds to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic on having a Sustainable Community by creating/enhancing affordable housing, education, and workforce opportunities and on Quality of Life by creating/enhancing neighborhoods, safety, and generational wealth set even further back for lower-income families when the pandemic forced them to consume discretional income and incur financial and housing instability.

Treasury also encourages the use of the funds on the eligible category of job training/workforce development (p. 22). Project Houseworks’ workforce opportunities programming responds to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic on having a Sustainable Community by providing paid internships, training, and mentoring to individuals “who want and are available for work” (p. 9), which includes job training, support for childcare and transportation to and from a jobsite, and other work supports. By addressing the construction workforce shortage specifically, this proposal contributes to a trained workforce pipeline for public jobs including but not limited to public works, public facilities, government construction engineers, construction-related school positions, and other vital suppliers of public infrastructure.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The program predominantly serves east of 72nd Street (identified as areas of racial/ethnic or minority concentration that also house the largest percentages of persons living in poverty and/or with low incomes per 2019-2023 Omaha Consolidated Plan, p.139-140), and concentrates services on both North and South Omaha. This proposal would allow the organization to increase staff capacity to increase affordable housing production in or adjacent to QCTs. This proposal allows Project Houseworks to continue serving that area but increase services in the South Omaha area, strengthening collaborations with the Latino Center of the Midlands, Bryan High School, and Canopy South. Preference will also be given to sites in South Omaha for the proposed capital project, to solidify the nonprofit’s commitment to South Omaha. Project Houseworks is currently in conversations about an opportunity to purchase the building located at 2316 South 24th Street (our current building), which is located in QCT 38.  QCTs and census tracts adjacent to QCTs will receive site priority for the capital project location and HAP properties. 

The homeownership opportunities described in this proposal address housing needs identified in both North and South Omaha Visioning Workshops. The Assessment of Housing Affordability (p. 6) echoed several of the workshops’ shared weaknesses and needs with: "[without] enough quality affordable housing to meet the need…the consequences for the region are significant: families face housing insecurity, community members face physical and mental health issues caused by poor quality housing, children are not in a position to reach their full potential, and the economic growth and vitality is constrained." 

Home Affordability Program satisfies the QCTs’ need for affordable housing by rehabilitating single-family homes to create decent housing, housing stability and preservation of naturally occurring affordable housing stock. Further, the program supports neighborhood revitalization, and helps stabilize the City of Omaha’s core Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Areas (NRSAs). Home Affordability Program can help impact the critical need for affordable housing in both North and South Omaha.

The requirement for participants to complete at least eight hours of HUD-approved homebuyer counseling prior to closing aligns with both workshops’ identification of need for financial literacy/education.

Both areas are beset with aging housing inventory. South Omaha’s identification of  low inventory of lots has led to discussions with Canopy South about collaborating on homes and/or lots. This addresses Project Houseworks’ business plan’s directive to contribute to affordable housing efforts in South Omaha, as well as increases trust since the South Omaha workshop identified predatory sales/rentals as a community concern.

The South Omaha Visioning Workshop also identified a need for meeting/community space. Project Houseworks would use this proposal to respond to this need by including such space in the proposed facility should we be successful in locating it in South Omaha. This space would be available for community  members to reserve, as well as provide space for community members to receive ancillary services like Project Houseworks’ collaboration with Legal Aid. Legal Aid’s pro bono attorneys assist our low-income clients with access to the economies that transfer on death deeds offer and help our homeowners with ensuring a legacy that creates stability for their families far into the future, along with an opportunity to build upon generational wealth.

Lastly, the intangible benefit of homeownership bringing stability to neighborhoods, which will benefit both North and South Omaha areas, addresses the North Omaha workshop concern of migration trends. A National Association of Realtors(r) study (2016) found that a person is significantly more likely to change residence in a given year if they were renting rather than a homeowner.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Preservation and creation of quality affordable housing aligns with LB1024’s transformational priority by re-energizing deteriorating neighborhoods and improving QCTs’ appearance. Owner-occupancy advances livability of the QCTs. A 2014 Penn State/UNLV study concluded that homes with owner-occupiers versus renters provide annual estimated community benefits of $1,300+ per property.

Purchase-rehab-resale (PRR) and new build activities deliver Fundamental Change. QCTs’ presence and quality of life are elevated through neighborhood revitalization, housing stability, and intangible homeownership impacts identified in a 2016 National Association of Realtors(r) study as educational achievement, civic engagement, physical and psychological health, and crime reduction. 

Homebuyers at 120% AMI or below can achieve their homeownership dream and begin building generational wealth through this proposal. By increasing quality, affordable homeownership in the QCTs, Long Lasting Economic Growth can help address racial/ethnic differences in homeownership driven by socioeconomic variables and decades of structural racism that denied BIPOC paths to homeownership and subsequent inherited wealth. Project Houseworks seeks ARPA dollars to create and promote paths to homeownership that are open and accessible (i.e., construction, staffing, workforce development/internships, homebuyer assistance/education, and affordable housing stock). This proposal would help 48 individuals/families afford to purchase homes and create generational wealth during the grant period. Going forward, Project Houseworks would have the capacity and scalability of its affordable housing development. 

This proposal’s employment opportunities also foster Long Lasting Economic Growth. The construction and real estate booms that bloomed during the quarantining crisis exacerbated the shortage of skilled construction professionals. Companies raised wages and added benefits to attract qualified talent (https://www.ketv.com/article/omaha-builders-are-enduring-a-crisis/37210544). The pandemic’s negative impacts on South Omaha residents, intensified highly disparate gaps Latinos already faced in educational and economic outcomes, i.e., lower ACT scores, lower college continuation and completion rates, lower incomes, lower rates of homeownership, higher poverty rates, and lower access to health insurance (Pew Research Center, 2014). Project Houseworks partners with the Latino Center of the Midlands to deliver paid construction internships. As Project Houseworks is preserving and increasing affordable housing stock in Omaha, the nonprofit needs people trained in construction skills. The Latino Center of the Midlands requires training space, experiential learning opportunities, and coordination for their Siembra Construcción program, a mentoring/work experience program for youth/young adults interested in construction management careers. In 2021, the partners piloted utilizing Home Affordability Program sites for high school students to gain residential construction work experience in areas identified by Project Houseworks’ home assessment, which may include basic/introductory level work on interior and exterior paint/stain, flooring, basic plumbing, railings, light electrical, fixture replacement / installation, landscaping, drywall, windows/doors, trim work, demolition, bathroom/kitchen remodels, et al. The addition of new construction offers valuable new build experiences, while the work on a new facility for Project Houseworks offers potential commercial construction opportunities. This proposal strengthens an emerging relationship with Bryan High School and lays the groundwork for developing additional relationships to increase internships. 

The capital project also supports Long-lasting Economic Growth .Project Houseworks current building is at capacity at 12 staff members. More space is required to add 6 FTE to keep homeownership affordable post-COVID.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The expansion of Project Houseworks’ workforce development partnership  with the Latino Center of the Midlands and Bryan High School would conservatively create 36 paid internships for youth between the ages of 16-23 (counted below within the temporary jobs count) during the grant period. This program not only has the potential to create up to 20 additional construction jobs in the community/year but also produce up to 20 newly trained construction professionals each year.

Y1 = 6-8 internships
Y2 = 12-14 internships
Y3 = 18-20 internships and sustained thereafter. 

This proposal adds 6 FTE to Project Houseworks’ staff (a Program Coordinator for the Home Affordability Program, a Workforce Development Coordinator, a Marketing and Communications Manager, a Finance and Reporting Associate and a Construction Specialist for the Home Affordability Program. The capital project supports this job creation, as Project Houseworks has outgrown its existing building with the current 12 staff members.

Project Houseworks performs as much of the repair, rehabilitation, and new construction work as possible with our in-house team of construction professionals. However, certain trades require outsourcing contracts. This work would support a minimum of  36 temporary contractors and their employees. We anticipate 400+ unique contractor engagements over the course of the grant period. These opportunities would continue after the grant period ends.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Project Houseworks submits an Economic Equity and Inclusion Plan (EEIP) to the City of Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department for approval annually. Certification is required to receive HUD dollars. Compliance requires nondiscrimination, affirmative action, and Equal Employment Opportunity conformance, for us and on behalf of our subcontractors.  Project Houseworks uses our EEIP to ensure our resource distribution creates racial justice and workforce opportunities for low-income and very-low income persons. To reach EEIP Small and Emerging Small Business (SEB) participation goals, we use the City’s SEB Directory to search for contractors. The Directory was created to stimulate the growth of small and emerging businesses in Omaha, with special attention to stimulating economic growth in areas having high levels of poverty. Tier I concerns are those headquartered in a census tract showing 30% or more persons below poverty level (or at least 15% of persons in the contiguous tract); and showing 20% or more of employees residing in such tracts. The SEB list also spotlights businesses owned by women and BIPOC community members.   Project Houseworks contact the City of Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department for candidates from the Section 3 Resident Registry/Database.when there are staff openings. Recipients of government assistance for housing, people with income that falls below HUD’s income limits may qualify as a Section 3 worker, targeted worker or Section 3 business concern. In addition, Project Houseworks posts notices for positions on LinkedIn and the Nonprofit Association of the Midlands’ career board.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> A National Association of Realtors study (2016) identified impactful intangibles of homeownership that this proposal supports. Not only has homeownership been proven to bring stability to neighborhoods, as referenced earlier, it shows a significant positive impact on educational achievement, with higher rates of homeownership also correlated with higher rates of community involvement and civic engagement. Quality of life is also tied to homeownership through better physical and psychological health. The research shows homeowners are 2.5% more likely to have good health. This relationship between homeownership and health benefits has large racial and ethnic disparities. Homeownership has also been statistically associated with crime reduction. The study found that foreclosures lead to an increase in neighborhood crimes of between 1.4-2.6%.

Project Houseworks’ PRR and new construction sales will impact neighborhood revitalization. A Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University article identified behavioral patterns that dwelling and maintenance appearance is better kept by homeowners. 

Project Houseworks is also proposing to purchase, rehab or build a new facility to support our growing program. We are working to determine whether we can purchase our current space at 2316 S. 24th Street (within QCT 38)  where we could rehab and expand into the 12,000 square foot space. We have identified the need  to house not only additional office space, but also garage space for the organizations vehicle fleet, secure storage space for building supplies and tools, and a multi-use area that would allow clients to meet with program coordinators and/or social workers, provide a community hall equipped for intern learning opportunities or neighborhood leaders to hold meetings and forums. If we are not able to secure this or another building space, we estimate securing 1.5-2 acres along I-480/US 75 corridor, preferably adjacent to a bus route to ensure senior and low-income clients accessibility, for a new building. The capital project will allow Project Houseworks to  provide more youths with paid construction internships, create new construction jobs, and subcontracting for new construction jobs that will help diversify the economy, while the community space will help improve livability for those in South Omaha and surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> As earlier referenced, the paths to homeownership that Project Houseworks’ proposal represents will allow the homebuyers to begin building generational wealth whose opportunities were either drained during the pandemic or unable to be initiated due to the health crisis requiring resources to be diverted. While the pandemic produced a major financial windfall for existing homeowners, home prices went up more than 25% in just 20 months (from Feb. 2020- Oct. 2021) (Layton, Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 01/26/2022). In addition to other pandemic-related expenses, the cumulative increase in just two years has decimated many low-to-middle-income (LMI) homebuyers’ plans to save enough for a down-payment. 

Project Houseworks’ Home Affordability Program sales prices are set appropriate for LMI homebuyers. Buyers with incomes at or below 120% AMI qualify through Project Houseworks’ lending partners for first mortgages carefully designed to keep total housing costs below 30% of monthly income, along with other down-payment assistance. Homebuyer benefits include purchasing quality homes less likely to require expensive repairs, down-payment assistance that helps homeowners keep their portion at $500 down, low affordable prices, and 8 hours of HUD-approved homebuyer counseling education. 

Affordability is passed along to homebuyers because Project Houseworks can make deep, necessary improvements or quality new construction single-family homes without depending on recapturing costs in sale/resale. In 2020, our PRR homes that required $165,000+ builder investments were sold for between $135,000-$140,000 to persons with incomes at or below 80% AMI as quality, affordable options within ranges compatible with low-income budgets. 

This proposal helps accelerate Project Houseworks’ plans to increase the identified community economic need of workforce housing stock for middle income homebuyers (income @ $58k-88k or 80-120% AMI). The Assessment of Housing Affordability has identified intense competition for homes in the $150,000-$250,000 range. Buyers ordinarily opting for homes within that price point must shift to less expensive stock, driving up costs of homes normally purchased by families at or below 120% area median income (ConPlan, p. 38-40). Communities benefit economically through preservation of affordable housing units for home ownership (vs. investor acquisition for rentals) that can help stabilize housing, including rental costs. In addition this proposal helps increase workforce development opportunities for youths in or adjacent to QCTs. It helps them develop skills and experience to have successful construction careers. Our programming also helps increase the construction workforce needed to keep up with the increasing demands for affordable housing production.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Our program is solidly grounded on the essential role that affordable housing strategies play in Omaha's economic recovery. The Assessment of Housing Affordability (2021) study warns that, without preservation strategies to maintain quality and affordability of existing, for-sale affordable housing, families "will face increasing housing cost burden and housing instability" (p. 65). The study identifies how "improving the quality of existing affordable housing units" (p. 12) must work together with new construction and rental units in the continuum of safeguarding affordable housing.   Our workforce development programming featuring Latino Center of the Midlands and Bryan High School features the innovation of adding to the construction workforce while increasing affordable housing stock. Because Project Houseworks’ team of highly skilled construction professionals conduct vigorous oversight and post evaluation, our Home Affordability Program sites provide ideal real-life settings for Latino Center of the Midlands’ Siembra Construcción program participants to learn and practice construction skills – while immersing themselves in a rewarding nonprofit culture of giving. Project Houseworks supplies training space, experiential learning opportunities, and coordination for their Siembra Construcción program, and separate funding provides paid work experience program for youth age 16-23 interested in construction careers. Eligibility for the Latino Center of the Midlands’ internships is determined through WIOA requirements for low-income (with a 5% low-income eligibility exception). Under WIOA, a youth who receives or is eligible to receive a free or reduced lunch is considered to be low-income. A youth living in a high-poverty area is automatically considered to be a low-income individual (in a Census tract or county with a poverty rate of at least 25% per ACS 5-year data).  The program piloted from June-August 2022 with 2 participants with planning for 8 participants in 2023.  Follow-on work experiences may include working in Project Houseworks’ Senior Repair Program, which provides low-income homeowners age 60 and older with free home repairs and modifications, as interns gain soft skills and work experience. The capital project also presents potential commercial construction work experiences for interns.   Scalability of the workforce collaborative is already established through Latino Center of the Midlands’ Siembra Nebraska umbrella that features not only the Siembra Construcción program, but also Siembra Raices (an urban gardening internship program), Siembra Medios (a multimedia communications internship program), Siembra Carreras (a business internship program in cooperation with the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber of Commerce), and Siembra Salud (a program giving students opportunities to become Certified Nursing Assistants while serving the community). In 2020, these programs served 456 students with workforce education and innovation opportunities. This grant ensures expansion, sustainability, and replication opportunities for the Project Houseworks-led construction workforce development activities.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The capital project will measure impact through providing:  *Increased services being provided to clients and the community.  *Increased internship opportunities (36 construction internship opportunities plus additional internship with existing and anticipated collaborators. Current non-construction internships have been created through partnerships with Creighton University and Champions of Aging, a Home Instead, Inc. initiative. Creighton University has been offering selected clients free student Occupational Therapy assessments (in 2021, 4 clients identified by our Certified Aging in Place Specialist received free student Occupational Therapy assessments). We are also negotiating a marketing/communications internship through the university. Champions of Aging provided a social work intern to link our clients to appropriate external services; *1500 volunteer opportunities – Project Houseworks’ annual volunteer event, Brush Up, matches teams to paint low-income seniors’ homes for free. For over 30 years thousands of volunteers have formed teams to paint the homes of low-income senior homeowners at no cost. In 2023, approximately 500 volunteers will paint 25 homes in our community. This event improves the quality of our clients’ homes and helps revitalize their neighborhoods.  Project Houseworks also collaborates with the Heating and Cooling Contractors Association (HACCA) whose members provide free furnace maintenance checks and replacements for our clients (67 in 2021) many involving dangerous conditions that put homeowners at risk.    Neighborhood revitalization measurements will also be set for the capital project, including nearby property improvements, new businesses attracted, and other property improvement outcomes.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Evaluation is currently conducted internally with processes developed that reinforce the quality of our work. Project Houseworks works to keep tight control over time, cost, and evaluation standards through our in-house team of highly skilled construction professionals. The evaluation team consists of the Executive Director and the Director of Operations, with input from the Construction Manager, Program Coordinator, and Workforce Coordinator. The Director of Operations is responsible for compiling statistical reports at month’s end for the Executive Director to disseminate to the Board of Directors. The Construction Manager will oversee the work of the construction staff and contractors.   The Director of Operations, Construction Manager, Workforce Coordinator and Program Coordinator will collect data on a daily basis with summaries produced monthly. Data and collection points include property closing statements, home assessment reports, project management timelines, surveys administered to homebuyers and interns, intern applications and interviews, and timesheets.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> In addition to the subcontracting opportunities described earlier, Project Houseworks is engaged in conversations with Canopy South to develop a plan to create more affordable single-family homes in South Omaha. This will include new construction and purchase rehab and resell. Such a collaboration would also give Project Houseworks site control to take advantage of more funding sources that require properties to be pre-identified. Canopy South is a nonprofit using a Choice Neighborhood Planning + Action grant to revitalize Southside Terrace in the Indian Hill neighborhood of nearly 8,000 residents. They are invested in the neighborhoods of South Omaha. Indian Hill Neighborhood is home to a diverse mix of residents including Latino, White, Black, and African Refugees from Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and The Congo. This collaboration could also be a catalyst for Project Houseworks Senior Repair Program to expand to extend free repair services to low-income immigrants and refugees.  In addition, a technical assistance grant from Nebraska Affordable Housing Trust Fund is funding exploration of financial institution products, CDFI possibilities, and other forms of homebuyer assistance, particularly to address the gap of products available for homebuyers between 80-120% AMI.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The rationale for the dollar amount requested is to allow Project Houseworks to develop and complete a capital project and increase staff capacity to increase its impact as it aligns with the goals with the Economic Recovery Act. This request helps the organization to realize its three year business plan. The plan is centered around increasing its impact in the development and preservation and development of affordable housing while increasing construction workforce in the community with a specific focus in South Omaha.

The purpose of this funding is to further grow our capacity to create more affordable housing while simultaneously developing additional construction workforce for our community.  Both are needed to combat the current affordable housing crisis that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

There has been other funding opportunities to develop affordable housing that we have not pursued primarily because we did not have the staff capacity to do so. This would help us accelerate our growth in order to meet the community need. And while there is significant money available for affordable housing development it is targeted towards project development and not for funding staff capacity and related administrative needs. This proposal would compliment the other funding available. 

While we are making a significant request we are leveraging other commitments to our Home Affordability Program and other private funding that supports the overall operations of the organization.

The funding requested for Workforce Development Coordinator would allow us to increase our capacity to integrate more youth interns into our work and also provide year round opportunities. The New Construction Manager and New Construction Specialist are needed positions in order for Project Houseworks to launch and successfully develop new construction single family homes. The Home Affordability Program Coordinator allows us to work with more homebuyers to help them purchase homes and ensure they are successful once they buy a home. 

We are requesting funding for a Finance & Reporting Associate to help with the administration of ARPA funding as well as the finance and and administrative needs of a growing organization. The addition of new construction will require the need for additional financial administration. Lastly, we requested funding for a Marketing & Communications Manager. This is not a current position for the organization. Our goal would be to hire a bilingual (Spanish/English) person for this position. This position would enhance Project Houseworks' ability to market its programming to the community. We would especially focus our outreach efforts in South Omaha. This additional position would allow us to create more awareness of our services in order for us to deliver on our mission.

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> As we have increased our impact and expanded our affordable housing programs, we have been able to increase both the level of support and number of organizations supporting Project Houseworks over the past few years. Our budget has nearly doubled from three years ago. Over the last year we doubled our general operations support from several private foundations. We anticipate that over the next three years we can continue to grow and increase our donor support in order to ensure long term sustainability of this proposal. The Marketing and Communications Manager would also be integral in helping us strengthen our infrastructure to increase support to the organization. It is also anticipated that increased affordable housing development will allow Project Houseworks to bring in additional developer fees to support the program.</p>

  <p> If we receive less than the full requested amount it ultimately impacts the timing of events. We plan to engage in a capital project but it may take longer than anticipated if we need to solicit other funding. If we receive less funding for staff capacity building we will prioritize positions based on most need.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> The funding provided through ARPA provides a foundation for initial expansion of our services into the HAP New Construction arena, as well as an expansion of our workforce development initiatives.  Once in place, the daily operations of the HAP teams can be replicated and expanded as future program funding increases.  Likewise, the Workforce Development program can be scaled to meet a rise in demand, and will evolve as both professional and educational partnerships continue to develop. The attached timeline and budget shows our scaling efforts over the term of the grant period.</p>
