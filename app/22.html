  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Mr. Coleman seeks to expand the services that he and other skilled construction industry associates, have offered a large number of individuals over the years. Please refer to the attached Business Plan for the Coleman Construction Training Institute (for more information). The Coleman Construction Institute was previously established in 1980. 

The funds from this Grant will provide the funding needed to Mr. Coleman to share much needed construction training expertise with students, utilizing a structure curriculum, and academic classroom environment, as well as "on-the-job" (OJT) training experiences. The teaching staff of the Institute will focus their efforts on attracting and engaging youth and adults, as well as individuals with disabilities (that are capable of performing construction trade tasks). The emphasis will be on helping male and female residents that live in the low income and poverty areas of North and South Omaha, who desire to obtain the needed skills to be successful in construction trades. A minimal fee will be required for most of the students to enroll. However, special accommodations to cover this fee will also be made available to individuals that cannot afford these fees in the form of scholarships. 

Our training curriculum and experiences are designed to provide skillfully-trained individuals, to help build up the number of workers available to fill much needed construction worker jobs. This would be for Coleman Construction projects, and other contractors for North and South Omaha projects. This will also help to help decrease the poverty rates of individuals and families within these communities in the City of Omaha. 

The existing building and project site at a location agreed upon by Coleman Construction Company and the Omaha Municipal Land Bank. Mr. Coleman has an agreement with the Omaha Municipal Land Bank to figure the location of the site.</p>
