  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The Descendants of DeWitty, NE would like to introduce our project. We are a non-profit corporation in Nebraska 501(c)3 status. On April 11, 2016, the state of Nebraska Historical Society honored DeWitty, with a Historical Marker on Highway 83, acknowledging the significance of DeWitty, NE. We are now six years young.
Our programs includes, a 12-piece and 25 - piece Traveling Photo Exhibit and Historical Reenactment, for museums and small venues. A Lesson Plan for elementary students that meets the Common Core Curriculum Standards including a teacher guide that correlates with our Historical Reenactment. We created an 8 - minute Animated Presentation on the Humanities Nebraska Speaker Bureau website under Virtual Tours. We are expanding our program to include technology which includes the Meta verse. Our vision is to develop a virtual reality game about the Descendants of Dewitty, Ne. Visit our new website https://descendantsofdewittyne.org/ - Multimedia Experience to find other untold African stories associated with American History.
Our Historical Reenactment and Photo exhibits has been presented at Creighton University, Metropolitan Community College, Great Plains Black History Museum, Peru State College, Cherry County Historical Museum, Homestead National Monument of America, Stuhr Museum of the Prairie Pioneer, University of Nebraska Omaha, Broken Bow Historical Society, Valentine Historical Society, Hastings Museum, Norfolk Library, Nebraska Wesleyan Lincoln, Cass County Historical Society, Nebraska History Museum Omaha Public Schools, and Durham Museum in 2023.

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our 25-Piece Photo Exhibit and Historical Reenactment has been on display in Museums and Small Venues it serves as a reminder of the African Americans contribution to the state of Nebraska. It is our hope that this project will inspire another person or family to begin researching their individual family history to locate and identify their humble beginnings. We will continue to show how our great grandfather’s dream of land ownership and education continues to play a part in the lives of his current day Descendants. The Mural, Street Sign and the DeWitty presentation and photo exhibit will serve as a Historical salute to our ancestors and to Black achievements in Nebraska. DOD legacy proves that we can have sustainable communities. In addition to educational training that provided a standard of quality life in DeWitty. Our story is still relevant today in generating entrepreneurs.</p>
