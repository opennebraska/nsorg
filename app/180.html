  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> 801S16, LLC is wholly owned by DANA Partnership, LLP (dba White Lotus Group), and involves a 55,000 sf former automotive dealership building that was purchased 5 years ago.

The Project, located adjacent to a QCT, is at 801 South 16th Street, or 15th and Leavenworth.  Its existing use has been as a thrift store and dog daycare facility.  Being located on Leavenworth, the property offers great accessibility to people interfacing with the site.  Current bus routes and walkability options connect this location with the rest of the Old Market and downtown Omaha.  

Given its historic and existing uses, there are environmental challenges with demolition, and its neighbor's diesel engine business has caused the site to deemed a brownfield site.  

We are seeking the assistance of ARPA to afford to have the existing thrift store relocate to a more fitting location, allowing this project to maximize its full potential. The redevelopment would reinvigorate the top level built along the street entry and provide for 65 underground stalls which could be used by the City of OMaha for the new public library less than .25 miles from the site.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The cost to upgrade and improve an existing structure to better reflect the goals of the city and program can only be done through a soft souce (ie. ARPA).</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The funds would be used to subsidize the design, historic consulting and rehabilitation of teh structure.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Our firm has a CPA/Controller that works with our engineering and construction management staff. Upon updating engineering with city of omaha public works approvals and bonding, a general construction contract alongside engineering and marketing fees defined, we would see to submit payment applications with associated lien waivers (approved by 3rd party engineer) for payment or reimbursement. That would continue until final pay application and payment.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> We believe that federal historic tax credit equity could be used to augment.  We would avoid TIF, but also utilize Valuation Incentive Program (capping property taxes for an 8 year period).</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> We can achieve historic tax credit approval by 1Q23.  Debt/Equity are already sourced, and the VIP program can be admitted upon qualifying as a historic revitalization project.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> no.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> no.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> We would be providing the equity in the building and securing additional debt to bridge the historic tax credit equity and capital necessary to move the existing tenant and rehabilitate the building.  We estimate ownership capital risk at over 3.5MM</p>
