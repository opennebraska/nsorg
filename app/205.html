  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> PO Boy Mega Alley, LLC (“The Mega Alley”) is a new limited liability company that intends to operate a start-up convenience store in North Omaha with an overarching goal of community betterment and togetherness. This proposal seeks funding to complete renovations to the building for the store location, commission of community-oriented murals for the exterior of the building, build a farmers market produce stand, and obtain picnic tables for public use near our location. To date, Myron Minnifield purchased the building and is providing a lease to The Mega Alley.  The Mega Alley has been working over the course of the last seven months to renovate the lot including the parking space and building location.  As part of these renovations, the parking lot has been smoothed and resurfaced, the exterior of the building has received a facelift, and the interior has undergone a full cleaning and renovation to add necessary shelving and storage for a convenience store.  The Mega Alley aspires to bring the North Omaha community together by providing a central location for day-to-day necessities, provide a community gathering place, and participate with local businesses and organizations to bring educational opportunities to North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley is seeking grant funding as a community small business striving to develop a one-stop-shop community convenience store providing daily necessities such as food, drinks, personal goods, and premade meals to improve the North Omaha Community and provide increased employment opportunities.  The Mega Alley is located at the southeast corner of North 30th and Kansas Ave. across from Miller Park. The lot began as a derelict lot with a falling down building.  The Mega Alley has already begun renovations on the lot and building to convert a former mechanics shop into a convenience store with plans to open the store by the end of 2022, and gradually add additions and programs as desired by its customers. In addition to creating local jobs, The Mega Alley has made contact with other local businesses to hopefully provide community outreach and education events.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Significant renovation has already taken place to the building structure.  The Mega Alley’s remaining project times are expected to be completed within the next eighteen months, by Spring 2024.

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> Greater community access to basic necessities that will be walking, driving, and bus accessible.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley is intended to not only be a convenience store providing daily necessities within easy access of community members, but also serve as a gathering place and foster involvement in the community.  The Mega Alley is directly next to a Metro transit, providing easily accessible goods, and directly across the street from Miller Park, conjoining North Omaha economic and recreation centers.  In addition to adding local jobs, the business is also attempting a partnership with Metropolitan Community College to provide the culinary program training space and Culinary Continuing Education opportunities.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley's proposal is the brainchild of two longtime North Omaha residents that understand the community and their potential customers.   First and foremost, the proposal is utilizing a previously vacant lot containing a crumbling building surrounded by community staples -- Miller Park, Bellevue University, Nelson Mandella Elementary School, and several churches within walking distance.  The proposal seeks funding to complete building renovations on an aging, yet viable building, and for items that support the business, but also connect the community, like offering a space for a farmers' market produce stand, placing picnic tables for casual outside dining and meeting space, and using the commercial kitchen to provide educational collaboration with the Metro Community College Culinary program and continuing education courses.  The Mega Alley eventually hopes to offer customers access to natural medicinal products within its store and potentially expand to an area for physical wellness, which are in short supply in North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley’s project aims to develop a convenience store that becomes engrained in the community by providing a constant service to customers, employment opportunities, educational training, and visual and productive improvement to a previously vacant corner lot.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Until renovations are complete, The Mega Alley will continue to hire contractors and laborers at their standard rates to complete the work. The Mega Alley anticipates around 10 temporary employment opportunities in the areas of general contracting, painting, drywall, electrical, and appliance installation. 
Once The Mega Alley convenience store is operational, The Mega Alley anticipates creation of 10-15 permanent jobs at rates around $15.00 per hour.</p>

  <p> 10</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> For temporary, current market rates; or permanent, above minimum wage.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley seeks to hire contractors, laborers, and purchase construction materials almost immediately to complete the building. After the building is complete, The Mega Alley intends to hire 10-15 convenience store employee jobs and conduct Culinary continuing education courses.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley proposal will benefit the surrounding community by cleaning up a formerly vacant lot and renovating the building to provide an attractive destination.   In addition, The Mega Alley is centrally located within walking distances of schools, churches, and parks that are central to everyday life.  The Mega Alley aims to provide a diverse inventory of products and take home meals that customers may not find at any other local store.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley proposal contributes to community sustainability by seamlessly incorporating its location into the surrounding area near public Transporation, providing both temporary and permanent jobs, providing a small, and locally owned business engaged with the community and providing educational opportunities.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Mega Alley is intentionally designing the inside and outside of its business with a key focus on community involvement, which diverges from that of all other convenience stores.  The Mega Alley has been innovative in the industry because the owners have a strong sense of community and want to bring that feeling to their business. They have planned the exterior to appeal to the community through murals, offering a farmers market type stand for customers to sell their garden products, incorporating picnic tables to feel more connected to Miller Park. The Mega Alley has set out to provide a combined customer and community experience.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Job creation, community beautification, community partnerships, and educational opportunities in culinary arts</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Such outcomes may be visually observed by the general community and neighboring businesses and organizations.  The owners of the business will be able to measure employment creation rates.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
