  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> ould push for viable business operating on North 24th street</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Addressing underserved, underemployed, unemployed, LMI and increasing quality of life through employment, job creation, wealth creation, new businesses boosting local economy, decreasing crime in low income communities.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> My experience over the last 20+ years, I have seen the needs and have collected data. Especially North Omaha businesses, that have started without the business education and often times the business fails. With the Small Business Education Academy cohorts are in a program that takes them from beginning of the start to a successful launch, and then ongoing mentoring to assist along the way.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> A few things needed in the business community, business owners need capital, there's capital, but they are not prepared for it. In the (Small Business Education Academy(SBEA), they get to have a certified master trainer to build credit as an asset, change their credit status in 4-6 months. Financial literacy, Understanding business taxes, Business credit and how to obtain it, management & operation, marketing their small business. By training business owners to manage and operate their business with knowledge allows them to continue to grow their business and begin to hire employees. That will change the neighborhood and the community along with the new hires  and their families.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> If we get the funding we train 50 entrepreneurs/business owners a year over the next 3 1/2 years, 175 trained business owners, with viable businesses, they each have a job and hire at least 1 employee, the potential of 350 jobs by 2026.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Collaboration with other larger organizations, as well as Work Force Development Solutions</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> By educating business owners to build viable businesses in the community, to hire in the community, by increasing the value of the properties in the community. When people work and own their property they tend to take care of it. That changes the community and can cause community buy in.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Just think about it, we have growing businesses in the community, we have people hired from the community, so we have changed 2 to 3 families in that one change.  If multiple businesses hire in the community how many communities could we change. It would change their quality of lie there would be hope.</p>
