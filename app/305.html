  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Local Art Plug’s mission is to make art accessible to everyone and provide resources for artists to take their careers to new heights. We do this by providing artists with connections to the community, opportunities for growth, and opportunities to earn extra income. We have multiple locations in mind where our plan will be successful and we are open to collaboration. Our current focus is to purchase the property at 822 Pacific St, Omaha, NE 68108. With the purchase of this property, we will be able to expand our services, build a creative community hub open to all, and develop tiny homes to create an artist village in South Omaha that is easily accessible. We currently work with elementary students through after-school arts education and see this as a great need for both high school students and adults.

Operating on a 3-year timeline, the first year will be spent developing community programs and STEM classes, as well as community engagement and outreach. We will also begin developing the land designated for the Artists’ Village. Year 2 will see an expansion of offerings in STEM and programming, with Year 3 seeing the completion of the Artists’ Village and furthering community partnerships.

South Omaha has a lower percentage of the population employed, 63 percent. As a result, South Omaha has a higher percent unemployed, five percent, or an unemployment rate of seven percent. South Omaha’s median household income is over $40,000 less than the BTDC. South Omaha’s median earnings are just less than $20,000 of the BTDC. Educational attainment is a common explanation for income disparity; however educational attainment does not close the income gap for South Omaha. The work we do will give not only South and North Omaha a chance to close the wealth gap without the need to go back to a traditional school. Once we receive funding we'll be able to expand our programming to 81 schools within 15 minutes of our location and impact 8,000+ unemployed people 16 years and older in both South and North Omaha to create a more connected, prosperous, employed, and skilled City.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Year 1:
STEM = curriculum development, educating partner solicitation
Community Hub = program development, community engagement + outreach

Artist VIllage = Rehab, land development

Year 2:
STEM = Community Partnerships, expanded offerings

Community Hub = facility development, Art+Wellness programming (youth, young adult, adult).

Artist Village = Homes installed, Artist solicitation, cohort planning

Year 3:
Continued growth in our 3 areas of focus and evaluation for moving forward after a full year of programming and artist village residencies

All construction and renovations will be completed</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal is to create not only a destination for tourists to visit and utilize but a safe space that is a community resource that uplifts current and future generations within North and South Omaha. Our proposal focuses on re-using existing infrastructure adding some slight additions that will accommodate multiple residents and be a community center for those looking to better themselves and their lives. We’re looking to serve the diverse populations of North and South Omaha with STEAM educational courses, rentable venue/gallery space, affordable housing, community center with state-of-the-art technology to create and explore new ideas and offer financial and mental health services. Teaching multilingual courses will allow us to broaden our impact even more.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal aligns with the visioning workshop summary capitalizing on the strengths of both north and south Omaha, mitigating the weaknesses in each area, leaning into the opportunities in both sectors, and acknowledging, but mitigating the threats that each possesses.

We will cater to the diverse and rich culture of Omaha by offering multi-lingual courses aimed at providing the tools and skills to live a better life. Currently, spaces that offer the creative community a gathering place to explore, learn, and grow are limited to non-existent in their capacity to help grow this sector of entrepreneurs. By capitalizing on the lack of existing infrastructure and repurposing older properties to fit the community's current needs. We can invest directly in the people in these diverse populations, by offering STEAM educational courses, rentable venue/gallery space, affordable housing, and a community center with state-of-the-art technology to create and explore new ideas. We plan to also offer financial and mental health services to those in need. Local Art Plug will give the youth and unemployed of the north and south the tools and skills to enter the workforce as well-paid professionals. By creating this creative hub that focuses on life, work, and play we can better serve the artist to fuel growth internally and externally. The Outlet would not only bring in visitors and artists from out of state, but also provide a way to change the current stigma of South O and/or North Omaha. To ensure that outside investment never makes its way into this project we would like the community to take ownership through the purchase of shares in a community investment trust.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> To forward Local Art Plug’s mission of making art accessible and aligning with LB1024’s strategic priorities. Our proposal aims to build a sustainable art community center/gathering hub and to do that we are proposing to purchase the property at 822 Pacific St, Omaha, NE 68108, however, we have multiple locations in mind where our plan will work and are open to collaborating on this cause. Using this space, we will be able to expand our artist-focused services, build a creative community hub, and develop an ‘Artist Village. From day one we will be able to offer courses focused on STEAM careers and teach job-ready skills to those seeking a college alternative. We see this type of alternative career path education as vital to the future of North & South Omaha. 

Operating on a 3-year timeline, the first year will be spent developing community programs and STEM classes, as well as community engagement and outreach. We will also begin developing the land designated for the Artists’ Village. Year 2 will see an expansion of offerings in STEAM, programming, and services, with Year 3 seeing the completion of the Artists’ Village and furthering community partnerships.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Temporary jobs can begin immediately and will supply skilled trade workers with consistent work till the facility is completed. We will hire contractors and laborers that represent the community we are moving into. Our permanent jobs will give those with skills a place to work and grow. We will also offer AR, VR, and XR services to companies as needed lessening the brain drain of Nebraska talent.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Allowing the community to have ownership investment trust, will help to spread wealth to families in the area. It will also diversify the local economy by creating Nebraska's first artist's village. A place that rents affordable housing to traveling and local artists.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal will turn a private greenspace into a community oasis. It would improve South Omaha's access to high-speed internet, state-of-the-art technology, gallery/venue rental space, affordable housing options, and educational courses to help stimulate economic growth ranging from finance to mental health to entrepreneurship.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> It will diversify the local economy by creating Nebraska's first artist's village. A place that rents affordable housing to traveling and local artists, it will boost Omaha’s creative talent by giving them state-of-the-art tech to explore, create, and capitalize on the future of digital media through the use of NFTs, Web3, VR, AR, and XR. These services can be utilized in conjunction with local businesses offering in-state resources for their VR, AR, or XR needs.</p>

We look to expand the possibilities of art and how we experience it through cutting-edge technology-driven exhibitions and experiences. We are also looking to expand upon the artists' village that we are creating. To do this we will need to purchase the plot of land next to this building to create the first of its kind in the midwest full sensory art museum. Finally, we want to take this model and continue to expand to different communities with satellite locations to make an even larger impact.</p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> Our idea can work in multiple locations, but we feel this space is the perfect location to foster community and mentor eager minds. The property is located at 822 Pacific St, Omaha, NE 68108. Originally built in 1890 as the heating facility for the Burlington railroad station and other businesses along 10th street. This location isn’t unique for its historical charms, but also its placement within the community. Upon entering you instantly feel transported to a private garden outside of the city, it gives you an overwhelming feeling of inspiration and peace. The facility and its nearby smoke stack are in tip-top shape, both have been inspected and approved by masons within the last two years. The roof has been replaced within the last 3 years. There is a geothermal heating system reducing utility costs and ample space for hosting people and events. The previous owner is a historian who’s kept the building’s original integrity intact giving it an industrial look with a well-manicured garden. This building will need some slight interior and cosmetic upgrades as well as a driveway extension and rear entrance created. Minor fixes would not prevent us from setting up and serving the community from Day one.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes, as we expand, we want to become innovative leaders in the field of digital and experiential art. We look to expand the possibilities of art and how we experience it through cutting-edge technology-driven exhibitions and experiences. We are also looking to expand upon the artists' village we are creating. To do this we will need to purchase the plot of land next to this building to be able to create a home and build the first of its kind in the midwest full sensory art museum. Finally, we want to take this model and continue to expand to different communities with satellite locations to make an even larger impact. We are currently operating within the smaller components version of this proposal.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> We currently host events at different locations throughout the city bringing artists to communities and audiences they normally wouldn’t interact with. Local art plug educates artists on best practices while giving back to the youth with after-school programming. Local art plug collaborates with local organizations and nonprofits to highlight community causes and issues. The budget reflects these offerings at a high level through a consistent space to host artists, a space to better serve our youth, and resources to create and explore their curiosities. The proposal for scaling would include the purchase of nearby property and renovation.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> We plan to use the funds received from venture investment and maverick venture as capital if needed totaling a $40,000 commitment and we’re not opposed to the collection of good debt, by taking out a loan ( conventional or FHA) to help mitigate cost for a property that would quickly turn a profit within a year and become self-sustaining within 2.</p>
