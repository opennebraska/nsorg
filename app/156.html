  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Civic Corner, LLC, owned by White Lotus Group (“WLG”), is requesting an award of funds via the Omaha Economic Recovery Grant to augment its capital stack for the block (the “Civic Site”) located at 1804 Capitol Avenue in North Downtown.  The 9-acre parcel attaches to an existing City of Omaha parking garage representing one of the largest developable sites in the core of our city.  Intersecting north and downtown Omaha and Creighton University, this large scale development achieves many LB1024’s visioned outcomes.
 
The now-cleared Civic Site originally was developed in 1954 as the largest event and convention center to serve the region. Its well known and accessible location makes it a prime place to build services and jobs that will lift North, South and other  neighborhoods targeted in LB1024.
 
Optimizing our vision, we will bring four pillars to the project that we believe will spur transformational change in areas such as employment, health and wealth-building homeownership. The four: 
•	Grocery and retailers (Federally Designated Food Desert)
•	Housing — Affordable and Market (includes home ownership) 
•	Employer
•	Civic uses (health care, wellness, child care)
 
The project site, part of the Omaha-approved Northeast Redevelopment Plan, also introduces new streets that enhance access to public transit for people working, visiting and living at the campus.  Additional federal sources may be available given its location within Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs).
 
WLG is working with the City of Omaha to redevelop the site and executed a purchase agreement mid-2022.  Since, several key announcements should augment redevelopment:  the Riverfront, Mutual of Omaha Headquarters, Urban Core Plan and a streetcar, the Project velocity has improved; however, to match best practices from competing cities, the Project will require substantial investment in site infrastructure, a subsidized proposal to a nationally recognized grocer, and other associated uses.  Per the council approved purchase agreement, execution of the development needs to occur within the timeframe associated with LB1024.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Civic Corner project has the unique opportunity to address many of the community needs with emphasis on integrating north Omaha and downtown Omaha.  Historically developed as a regional convention center, the full city block has strong multimodality options including walkability, bus routes and interstate access thereby boosting its viability.

During LB1024 townhall sessions, it was stated that providing jobs, housing and associated services were some of the priorities of the program, opportunities for integrating those uses prove to be exponentially more impactful.  Civic Corner introduces each of those uses in a logical way so that each of the associated patrons can augment the other aspects of the development maintaining viability and ultimately sustainability.  Additionally, our most vulnerable populations would have housing, employment, healthy food, and needed services contained within one district.   The quality of life impact improves not only for those families in need, but also for the businesses that need the services from the same population.  Lastly, the integrated approach also desensitizes existing cultural barriers that DEI efforts are attempting to address.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Strengths:
-Connects North Omaha and Downtown Omaha
-Multimodal transportation exists (Transit-Oriented Development)
-City of Omaha Support

Opportunities
-Catalyzes investment in surround areas
-Integrates uses for diverse population
-Offers employment services, and wealth generating home ownership

Addresses Weaknesses
-Process to redevelop requires community input
-Creates jobs in our Urban Core and North Omaha strengthening our city
-Connects what has been disconnected

Challenges our Threats
-Develops without displacement
-Cost outpaces affordability is managed through community support</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> •	Safe and affordable housing (includes wealth generating home ownership)
•	Home Ownership
•	Jobs, Jobs, Jobs (not only onsite, but walkable to the largest employers)
•	Needed Services – Grocer, health, wellness, childcare
•	Wanted Services – Restaurant, lifestyle
•	Multimodal transportation
•	Within a QCT
•	Adjacent to educational institutions
•	Will cause additional investment in the surrounding areas</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> 1500 jobs would be created in the QCT (between $35k to $250k)</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 1500</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 250</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> $25-$40 for temp jobs.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We would implement a set aside program that would engage minority and disadvantaged businesses.  Depending on how the ownership would be structured would be tailored accordingly.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> We believe project has multiple benefits including creating and expanding a local neighborhood, increasing livability by incorporating multiple uses, addresses food insecurity by delivering a grocer in a federally designated food desert, creates jobs by adding an employer and casts a wide net for people regionally to engage this destination.   As referenced in the mapping tools, the site has 62 affiliated organizations on top of its northeast downtown association.  The Developer is committed to including public input as part of our development process.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The Project can serve an a large scale development at the midpoint of North Omaha and Downtown.  It contributes in an inclusive, sustainable manner by developing a self contained district as well as introducing uses that would draw regionally.  The unique approach of introducing streets enhances an already strong transit-oriented development.  Those served by the district will have service options, grocery options, living options and employment options.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Several prior projects have brought ideas to this site that the market could not bear.  With the assistance of the Economic Recovery Act, we can further expand on civic commitments being made.  These include introducing more high-rise structures, lifestyle projects that attract talent to our community and building sustainably.  Coupling the arts with design, the site’s canvas has many options to put Omaha’s north downtown on a regional/national map.  Additional options for ESG related investments could be incorporated.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Economic Development, Housing created (affordable and home ownership in particular), Services offered, Addressing Food Desert Designation</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Economic Development (City of Omaha) - Invested Capital, Jobs Created, Sales Tax Revenue, Property Tax Revenue.  Affordable Housing Built and # of Occupants Served (NIFA) Services offered (Civic Users's Annual Report)</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> ABSOLUTELY!  The addition of the use are will spur development and investment in surrounding areas.  The contemplated housing for the employment created cannot be solved simply within the site.  Moreover, the grocer would appeal to users within a 5-10 mile radius which would only magnify investment interest in the North & South Omaha and our Urban Core.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Rationale towards assisting with multiple aspects of the project include:  Site Infrastructure  (This will enable all facets of the project to improve viability and absorption).  Addressing difficult to construct, dense infill projects to include harder investments:  Civic Uses and Affordable Housing.  Lastly, subsidizing a grocery operator will have a return on investment to the city exponentially.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Site Infrastructure - we are introducing streets in the development (losing developable land) to improve accessibility.  This also requires more structured "district" parking (all users).  Grocery subsidy - we believe that to solidify LB1024 service areas and beyond, we must bring a grocery operator to market (this plan would subsidize that operator to function).  Affordable Housing and Civic Uses will expand the diversity and include a wider cast of patrons to the project.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Our firm has a CPA/Controller that works with our engineering and construction management staff.  Upon updating engineering with city of omaha public works approvals and bonding, a general construction contract alongside engineering and marketing fees defined, we would see to submit payment applications with associated lien waivers (approved by 3rd party engineer) for payment or reimbursement.  That would continue until final pay application and payment.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> City of Omaha subsidies, Charitable contributions, Enhanced Employment Area, Tax Increment Financing.
Additional opportunities exist including Low Income Housing Tax Credits (affordable housing), new market tax credits or otherwise.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> We have already begun seeking additional sources; however, our request only includes those that we can commit to today. (LIHTC, TIF, City)</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Limited.  The project may be able to proceed; however, in a much smaller, less impactful manner.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> yes.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> By introducing the street grid into our plan, we have separated the site into 4 distinct quadrants.  We are able to create a logical phasing plan without negatively stigmatizing another portion of the project.  That being said, the collection of uses complement each other and augment the sites overall success.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The Organization has arranged for the financing the Debt & Equity for the development.  We will do the necessary to ensure the success of the overall project.  Additionally, the organization is committed to pushing the velocity in which the Project is delivered, and delivered in an agreeable timeframe.  This includes the option to JV with other developers to manage various portions of the Project.</p>
