Early Childhood Education and Childcare: 
Discovery Dream School wants to become a licensed childcare center and preschool program that provides high quality childcare for children ages 6 weeks to 13 years of age. We will offer traditional schedules, part-time schedules, drop-in care, before and after school care and summer programs for school age children.

We  will provide a safe and nurturing environment for your children. We will encourage respect and honesty into each individual child. Every child will have an equal opportunity to grow mentally and physically within our program.

Latronda Jordan will be  the owner and director which will allow her  to be heavily involved daily and in the building at all times. Latronda has a vast amount of knowledge and expertise in the field of early childhood education. Children at Discovery Dream School are more than just a number, we value relationships, connections and family. As an owner I will make this a priority and a way of conducting business. I will be fully invested in the families I provide care to. Families will be impressed with our open layout and design. Not only will children have classrooms that meet their developmental needs but there will also be  plenty of opportunities for play and exploration.  Discovery Dream School will  invite  several community partners for basketball, soccer, yoga, dance, cooking, foreign languages and much more so our kiddos are always engaged while acquiring new and exciting skills.

 Children will forever and always be our future. Our school believes education is more than just learning from books, itâ€™s also about obtaining life skills. We take great pride in making sure your child has an understanding of resilience, determination, and perseverance because even when your child finds something difficult this approach will teach them that they can achieve, overcome, and execute anything. If you were to invest, why not invest in the future?</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Latronda is wanting to rent out a building space with minor things to fix so she can finally open up her own childcare center to help the omaha, ne community. How my childcare center will be different is that I will like to supply diapers and wipes for every child in my center. Providing diapers and wipes can help out so many people within our community. There are parents who are struggling to provide the bare min so this will also take off stress from parents which will reflect on their mentality. Just like that our community will start to feel like we finally have their backs. 

Discovery Dream School will be located in the Millard area which is in need of good quality childcare. The surrounding area is growing at a rapid rate and it would take my childcare center less than 6 months to get full with children. 

Discovery Dream School will have a waitlist at opening and continue  to have a waitlist throughout the duration. We concur that our community is suffering from the lack of quality childcare programs available. Latronda is very active throughout her city and has established a high quality reputation throughout the childcare  programs she has worked for. Families are asking for her support to develop more quality childcare options in our community.

In January of 2021, Latronda began planning her childcare business plan. She is set on providing parents in her community peace
and assurance that better childcare options are coming their way. Her community is behind her and ready to support Discovery Dream School opening as a childcare center. 

The Company will employ 17 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees.


Business Mission
This is more than just a childcare center. This is the dream of one person who made it into a reality. Discovery Dream School not only focuses on your child's mental and physical development, but also promotes independence and collaboration. The goal of this strategy will give your child the skills to think independently and in a group setting. We believe in teacher-led activities because children thrive better when they have a consistent routine and classroom structure. There is a time for everything and a season for every activity, a time to play and a time to learn.

Funding Request
The Company requests a total loan of 533,000 over the course of 10 years, to be used for the following purposes:

Discovery Dream School is seeking funding to open a childcare center in the Millard area. We would like to rent out a commercial property which will allow us to better serve our Omaha ,Ne  community.

1. We will need funding to solidify a lease agreement that will require 10,000 down for a down payment.

2. For all new childcare centers the new state law is that all childcare centers have to have a storm shelter and sprinkler system. The building that I am looking at already has a storm shelter half way built. I would need 250,000 to finish building the storm shelter and to put in a sprinkler system. 
3.The building that I am wanting to lease will need minor cosmetic improvements estimating $50,000

4. We will need to furnish our classrooms, playgrounds. These estimated cost are about $50,000

5. We will need funding for providing diapers and wipes for the first year which is estimated to about 33,000.

6. First 3 months for payroll 100,000

7. Licensing Fees and Inspections for the first 3 months is estimate to about $30,000

8.I will also need an outdoor sign which will be about $10,000</p>

  <p> THE NEED
The Omaha,Ne community is in need of more childcare centers. As more research underlines the importance of early childhood education, the demand for educators is increasing. By the year 2029, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 30,000 jobs will open up for childcare workers and preschool teachers. The building I am interested in renting is in an area that's in high demand for quality child care centers.</p>
