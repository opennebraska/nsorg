  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Company shall be formed as Limited Liability Corporation under Nebraska state laws and headed by Damone Williams.  
House of Darda and House of Bethel is a Transitional Living Program that serves as a resource for youth ages 17 to 20 who struggle with a lack of housing, support, education, and independent living skills. Young adults in the program live at the Jacobs’ Place housing units where they find the stability and security they desperately want and need. Under the structure and staff supervision of the Jacobs’ Place Program, these youth are empowered to transition from a state of crisis to one of safety and growth.
What makes House of Darda/Bethel unique and special are the opportunities offered through this life-changing program:</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Approximately 30 percent of people experiencing homelessness are younger than 24 years of age. The trauma of homelessness, even short term, can have a major effect on a youth’s future development. Children who experience homelessness have significantly higher rates of emotional, behavioral, and immediate and long-term health problems. They often struggle with self-esteem issues, which puts them at risk for substance abuse, death by suicide, sexual exploitation, prostitution, and other negative outcomes. They have numerous academic difficulties, including below-grade reading levels, high rate of learning disabilities, poor school attendance, and failure to advance to the next grade or graduate. Four out of five children who experience homelessness have been exposed to at least one serious violent event by age 12.
Family conflict and “aging out” of the foster care or juvenile justice systems may play a significant role in a youth’s experience with homelessness. According to the report “Missed Opportunities:  Homeless Youth in America, one in 10 young adults (ages 18-25), and at least one in 30 adolescents (ages 13-17), experience some form of homelessness unaccompanied by a parent or guardian over the course of a year. Unaccompanied youth can find it difficult to find a place to live and someone willing to rent them a room.
Furthermore, youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, or queer disproportionately experience homelessness. They are at substantial risk for family rejection, physical assaults, sexual exploitation in shelters and on the streets, and trauma, mental and substance use disorders. Providing safe, supportive, and welcoming environments for LGBTQ youth is essential for reaching this vulnerable population.

Proposal Impact: 
87% of our targeted youth have experienced one or more adverse childhood experiences    
64% have never participated in any extracurricular activity
41% run away from home
67% come from single parent homes
49% have a parent who has been incarcerated
When youth are unprepared and unsupported to transition to adulthood, there are many negative impacts and excessive costs to the community. The Company is passionate about our mission to support and strengthen youth, young adults and families through services that inspire and equip them to lead independent, productive lives. Your support enables the Company to create a stronger, more thriving community by helping marginalized youth realize their full potential.</p>
