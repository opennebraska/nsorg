  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Unsung Heroes Cultural Center for the Arts (UHCCA) Conceptual Design, was developed to provide an architecturally beautiful and functional facility that residents of North Omaha, South Omaha can take pride in. The “Unsung Heroes” include African Americans, Native (Indigenous) Americans, Hispanic (Latin) Americans, and Woman, who have made significant contributions, and sacrifices that have not been recognized, or stories have not been fully shared. The UHCCA has been designed to provide a space where the racially diverse and multi-generational urban communities of North and South Omaha, can educate, celebrate, and experience the richness of each other’s culture under the same roof. 

The Museum is designed to house cultural art, historical artifacts, and provide a theater/multipurpose gathering space for music, dance, theatrical performances, educational lectures, and community/professional meetings or conferences. 

The Library would house books and digital media. In addition, a separate Commercial/Retail building would be located at the entrance plaza of the UHCCA. It is designed to provide leased TI spaces, in which the revenue can be utilized to support the financial sustainability of the UHCCA. It is also intended that the facility would host annual conferences as a means to generate income. 

The primary spaces in the UHCCA are listed below:
A.	Museum 
B.	Library (w/ classrooms, study rooms, and community meeting rooms)
C.	Black Box Theater & Multipurpose Room
D.	Administration Offices
E.	Retail/Commercial Building Units 

Upon the award of this Grant: Barbara Ingram intends to also serve as the UHCCA Acting Board President/Owner’s Representative (until a Board is developed that includes stakeholders from each of the groups identified). Ms. Ingram’s first duty in this role, will be to establish the UHCCA as a non-profit (501c3) organization.

The Site location is currently proposed to be at the northeast corner of Adams Park (in North Omaha at Bedford Avenue and John A. Creighton Park Blvd.). Other available sites may also need to be considered, that might serve as a more centralized location between North and South Omaha.

Timeline: It is intended that the UHCCA’S project would be constructed by July 31, 2026.</p>

Quality of Life - If the Adams Park site is approved, it would be good for the UHCCA   to form an alliance with the Adams Recreational Center on the site to encourage their patrons to utilize both facilities. Particularly to also take advantage of the walking paths and outdoor spaces at the park when the visit the UHCCA facility.</p>
