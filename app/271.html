  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> □	Transformational Change - This proposal will transform would literally transform 16th Street through major investments in underutilized lands. The investment will generate construction jobs and allow for recruiting companies that will add high paying jobs in much needed office and retail space.  

□	Fundamental Change - By strategically locating on 16th street, the LSD will reconnect North Omaha with the downtown community (both through a trail and 16th street), a connection that was previously severed. In addition to connecting the community, the District will also create a true business district in North Omaha which has been missing. 

□	Long-Lasting Economic Growth - The proposal provides multi-faceted economic growth, in digital, manufacturing, construction, as well as, entrepreneurship and innovation all within one mile.

The Revitalization of the 16th Street Corridor is crucial to the overall development of North Omaha.

The revitalization of the 16th Street Corridor ties together the community with the 	business park and IHub.  By creating additional commercial spaces,  small businesses will have access to store fronts and have the ability to continue to grow in the community.  Moreover, with multipurpose building that have retail on the bottom and housing on top, much needed housing stock will be added to the area enabling people to work live and play. Finally with a true commercial BID in North Omaha, businesses will be able to contribute and continue to invest in the community creating longevity and lasting change after federal dollars have been spent.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Affordable housing and walkable communities were at the top of the needs list in the Visioning Workshop.  This proposal addresses both.  

We will seek RFPs  for development of mixed-use and affordable housing units along 16th Street thereby locating housing where jobs will be created, eliminating the barriers that lack of transportation has created.</p>
