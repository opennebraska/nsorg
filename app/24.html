  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Pleiades Media Group (PMG) is an African American majority-held media company. We established PMG to produce and manage content for global distribution.  These types of properties are capital-intensive yet scaleable with success. PMG is applying for the Omaha Economic Recovery Act Coordination Plan financial grant to fund the development of a state-of-the-art production facility along with the production of incredible licensable IP.  PMG proposes the creation of this facility in an economically challenged area of Omaha providing the community with measurable transformation, fundamental changes and long-lasting economic growth. As a relatively young company we have managed to secure works from seasoned Hollywood writers. We have contracted with a leading Hollywood Executive Producer, Ann Marie Sanderlin for our HitMaker IP property. We are in formal talks with iHeart Senior Executives for a Strategic partnership with our HitMaker IP property, and in addition to being in talks with Netflix, Disney + and Amazon we are securing distribution and publishing partnerships with level one companies. These are key accomplishments for PMG as they are in preparation to PMG entering into production upon funding, building acquisition and sound stage/recording studio buildout.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> PMG is applying for the OERAC Plan to fund $20M to develop a state-of-the-art facility and produce licensable IP. 
PMG proposes to create this facility in an economically challenged area providing the community with measurable transformation, fundamental changes and long-lasting economic growth. PMG will spark an unmeasurable amount of curiosity and possibilities within the area's youth and make significant long-term economic contributions directly through full-time jobs, part-time jobs, contracted work, and capital spending with neighboring businesses. 
PMG will meet funding objectives, it will also meet the identified community needs through educational programs, and Gaming initiatives. We have identified a building that is within a 15-minute walk from two educational campuses and within a 15-minute car ride from a third.
The pandemic's huge direct negative impact on the Music, Television, and Film industries is undeniable. PMG could not produce content or obtain financing in the private or public sectors during this time (Robert Fairlie, A Robb, D Robinson, Black and White Access to Capital among Minority-Owned Startups, NBER Working Paper 28154: Black Owned startups, for example face larger challenges in raising capital, including securing business loans), The pandemic directly affected our ability to identify distribution partners and to raise working capital.
This Grant will contribute to the success of the disproportionately impacted community located in QCT 19 of Omaha. Government has identified this area as disproportionately impacted and has established funds to rectify the communities circumstances.
The Nebraska Revised Statute 81-12,241-d states “with no less than thirty-five million dollars in such grants allocated to eligible grantees which are located south of Dodge Street and east of 72nd Street.” PMG is asking to participate in a portion of such grant funding for 2215 Harney St which is within these boundaries. 
Such an investment in PMG restores the negative impact of the pandemic with both measurable and immeasurable benefits to area and within six months we will be fully operational positioning the area to be a leader in the State with new innovative technologies, careers, and a clear path forward.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> We are submitting this proposal for active funding from the grant in order to secure the 2215 Harney St building as it is currently on the market. This acquisition should take place as soon as possible due to the ideal structure and infrastructure associated with this property and its geographic location is key for our community based programs. If we are funded expeditiously through the Grant we will complete the acquisition of the property within 30 days and begin our remodel and buildout with a targeted 6 month completion date and begin IP production. (Please review the included document for a more detailed timeline)</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> PMG is in a "Negatively Impacted Industry" and will meet funding objectives of this "Negatively Impacted Community". It will also meet the identified community needs through educational programs, and Gaming initiatives. We have identified a building that is within a 15-minute walk from two educational campuses and within a 15-minute car ride from a third.
The pandemic's huge direct negative impact on the Music, Television, and Film industries is undeniable. PMG could not produce content or obtain financing in the private or public sectors during this time (Robert Fairlie, A Robb, D Robinson, Black and White Access to Capital among Minority-Owned Startups, NBER Working Paper 28154: Black Owned startups, for example face larger challenges in raising capital, including securing business loans), The pandemic directly affected our ability to identify distribution partners and to raise working capital.

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Our business model is such that we will create career opportunities that are in front of the camera and behind the camera, technical and creative which could result in 200 to 250 people supporting a production. Our wages will be at union scale and we will have a significant economic impact to the community. An example of such is HitMaker will have a below the line production budget of $3 million these funds are spent among the production teams, area services providers and contracted labor.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> PMG will hire no less that 22 employees, approximately 18 full-time and 4 part-time.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> The nature of our business is that temporary jobs are significant and tied to productions. We will create significant project based construction jobs for our refurbishment of our building and additionally for sound stage and recording studio buildout.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Our proposed job wage levels are as such:  Ranging from $15 an hour part-time and $21 an hour full-time for hourly waged staff. Salaried employees will range from $75-85k per year</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> It is the very nature of our business model to engage with community services providers to support our productions. We will begin hiring portions of our staff upon receiving of the grant and closing on the building. During the next six months we will initiate hiring to become fully staffed with local talent.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Because of the presents of PMG this community will benefit in the following ways that it would not have ordinarily benefited:

  <p> Like other communities in Georgia or North Caroline, Nebraska and our local community will benefit from direct economic contributions to the area and the benefits of a national awareness that PMG will bring to Omaha is priceless as it could encourage further growth in this highly lucrative industry. It may also attract additional support industries over the medium term.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> PMG will be providing Omaha with one of its first Cinematic LED Sound stages. This is the technology that is replacing the traditional green screens that have been popular though the years. In addition we will be providing Omaha with a state of the art Dolby Atmos Recording and Mixing sounds studio. Dolby Atmos along with Loss Less Audio are quickly becoming the standard of choice for steaming music listeners.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> There are multiple measurable outcomes to PMG receiving these grant funds including but not limited to the millions fo dollars that will be spent annually within the community but also the untold benefits to students and young adults having access to leading edge technology, Hollywood level talent and just the overall good will that PMG will establish within Omaha. Our hands on approach with neighboring educators will allow these local schools to become brighter lights for the student bodies through participating in our programs.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> These outcomes may be measured by the City and County revenue departments in addition to educators with the ability to measure the social impacts from our programs.</p>
