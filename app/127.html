  <p> All jobs would be in QCT 63.03 or QCT 62.02</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The North Omaha Health and Wellness Center will provide a full range of health-related services, typically beyond what other health care providers such as hospitals or out-patient clinics provide. This means in addition to providing comprehensive primary health care services The Center also will offer mental health services, as well as “supportive services” that can include nutrition education, translation services, care coordination and case management, transportation to and from health care sites, and outreach activities to help find eligible candidates for its services. This also means the care delivered is culturally appropriate and community relevant in an attempt to increase compliance.
Because of the influence of the community board and their commitment to comprehensive health care, The Center will tailor the services it provides to meet the specific needs of the community. The Center will provide weight reduction programs, case management services, and have services on site like interpretation/translation to help patients identify additional programs for which they might be eligible.
The Center will continuously evaluate its work and will consistently show that it provides care that improves health outcomes to individuals that seek its assistance. The Center’s clients are also more likely to identify a usual source of care, and report having better relationships with the health care providers of The Center. This focus on primary care and the provision of additional supportive services are among the reasons that care delivered by The Center is less expensive and ultimately saves money to the broader health care system by eliminating unnecessary emergency room visits and other hospital-based care.
As you are well aware, minority communities were among the hardest hit during the most recent international pandemic, and are among those recovering the slowest from that deep economic downturn. The combination of employment insecurity and rising income disparities leading to people of color less likely to be able to enter into the home ownership market is especially felt in communities of color. The Center serve much higher proportions of minorities and will be located in area that is heavily minority dominated. The creation of The Center now allows for a direct funnel to the community of need where the extra economic benefits will be especially valuable.  This gives The Center the capacity to ramp up quickly and provide quality health care services for communities most in need. In addition to health services, any assistance to The Center comes in the form of new economic growth and new jobs.</p>
