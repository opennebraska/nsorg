  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Stephen Center and Arch Icon Development Corporation are collaborating for a brand-new Stephen Center Campus in North Omaha (QCT) and new construction expansion at the South Omaha (QCT) Stephen Center facilities.  The location identified for the North Omaha campus is near 30th and Sorensen Pkwy and will consist of 3 buildings.  Building 1.) Emergency Housing Shelter; Building 2.) “HERO” Building serving men and women/families with separate wings; and Building 3.) Administration / Supportive Services Building.  The South Omaha development will be new construction of a Women / Family Building to serve separately from the men.  The men will stay at the current HERO Building.
Additionally, Arch Icon and Stephen Center of Omaha are partnering for the significant renovation of the current Stephen Center HERO Program Building supportive housing facility.  The HERO Building, located at 5217 S 28th Street – Omaha, is for individuals caught in the chronic cycle of homelessness, poverty and substance abuse served by the Stephen Center.  The building was originally constructed and funded as a NIFA/LIHTC “CRANE” Development in 2005.  HERO consists of (16) Two-Bedroom Units (4 Beds), a small common area with kitchenette and a bathroom.  Residential floor amenities include laundry, common space with a lounge. It has the capacity to serve 32 men and 32 women.  The lower levels consist of offices, service rooms, meeting rooms, classrooms, mechanical room, and restrooms.  The building has had 16 years of intense wear and tear as a continuous, max-capacity of clients are served.  Mental health treatment and supportive services have drastically changed over the years from the original building design.  The intent of the extensive renovation is to update the building with modern finishes, repair and replace broken and failing materials, address structural concerns and modify for a more functional floor plan layout.  The interior will be made less institutional, to have more of a residential aesthetic.  The basement and first floor will be significantly altered, with structural changes and modification of original floor plans and the second and third will be altered as well, in common spaces.  The residential units will generally retain their current layouts, but receive all new finishes, built-ins and casework. Exterior replacements, repairs, tuckpointing, windows / doors and painting will be addressed.  As well as site-work including refreshing landscaping and hardscaping.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Stephen Center’s proposal aligns with the identified community goals by aligning with the fundamental goals of Transformational, Fundamental Change, Long-Lasting Economic Growth, and a Sustainable Community.  The mission of Stephen Center is to “partner with individuals, families, and the community to overcome homelessness, addiction and mental health challenges.  Stephen Center operates the only HUD Recovery Housing projects in the MACCH (Metro Area Community of Care for the Homeless) service area. A HUD “recovery housing” project maintains a substance-free environment. Program participants must be drug and alcohol-free and committed to sobriety while living on campus. Stephen Center has found that client success rates increase when provided the option to enter programs providing a structured, safe and sober environment. Second, Stephen Center is the only emergency shelter with a state-licensed addiction recovery program on campus, providing the community’s most vulnerable homeless men and women with mental health and substance abuse recovery programming, free of charge.  Stephen Center’s funding goals of Transformational, Fundamental Change, Long-Lasting Economic Growth, and a Sustainable Community are aligned with the North and South Omaha identified needs outlined in the Public Engagement Survey.    
•	In South Omaha, Stephen Center’s proposal will provide investment in new affordable housing and new mental health facilities that is culturally responsive and respectful. This proposal creates sustainable high paying job opportunities with high paid professional opportunities as well.  Additionally, the proposal will increase an established internship pipeline that leads to professional job opportunities.
•	In North Omaha, Stephen Center’s proposal will provide investment in physical structures along the 30th Street corridor with safe/affordable quality housing and mental and substance abuse healthcare programming including advocacy, resources and awareness. This proposal will create mixed job opportunities with good wages including high paying professional job opportunities.  This proposal is located in an accessible area close to the community supports and services needed for individuals and families to emerge from homelessness, addiction and mental health crises.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> South Omaha
Stephen Center’s proposal aligns with South Omaha’s Visioning Workshop with the provision of new affordable housing options for individuals and families needing mental health and substance abuse services.  This proposal would address the need for “Mental Health Facilities and Programs” with the addition of Female/Family HERO facility treating mental health/substance abuse treatment and programming to our community’s most vulnerable women and children. Additionally, the proposed Female/Family HERO building would double the capacity of the men’s HERO program which will assist in meeting the community’s need for men’s mental health/substance abuse treatment and programming.
The proposed facility is “Walkable” and “Connects to Public Amenities” with a location at 27th and Q Street and a proximity to public amenities such as Metro Community College (MCC), One World Health Center, Salvation Army KROK Center, Metro Bus Transit Center, and the South Omaha Public Library.
The Female/Family HERO proposal would increase the “internship pipeline into professional jobs” with a need for 10-12 students per semester.  Additionally, this proposal would “grow job opportunities in South Omaha that “pay median…and high paying jobs” with an increase of 13.6 FTE (full-time equivalent) positions. 
North Omaha
Stephen Center’s proposal aligns with North Omaha’s Visioning Workshop with the provision of “safe/affordable housing” opportunities along with “mental health/substance abuse programming, resources and awareness”.  Stephen Center brings a “successful business” proposal to the North Omaha community.  The proposal would begin with an “investment in physical structures…along the 30th Street corridor” in the construction of a North campus which is estimated at $26.5 million; with approximately $10 million from sources outside of this funding such as “private investment” and other grant opportunities.  Once constructed the proposal would fund approximately 68 new FTE positions providing “jobs accessible to all individuals…including high paying professional opportunities…over $60K per year”.  
This proposal would create the need for 30,000+ of volunteer support providing “community internship opportunities with high school youth” along with practicum opportunities for students in area colleges and universities such as MCC, Creighton University, and UNO (University of Nebraska at Omaha). 
The proposal would “generate the need for affordable housing, daycare, resources, and community entertainment” in North Omaha to support the proposed 68 FTE positions and approximately 200 volunteers who provide supports and services to over 250 residents/program participants residing on Stephen Center’s proposed North Omaha Campus.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Transformational - The areas of North and South Omaha are historically where the most vulnerable of our Omaha population lives, a problem only compounded by Covid with a degree of disparity worse than that suffered by any other class.  To truly transform North and South Omaha, housing, facilities and services for the homeless, those with behavioral disorders and substance abuse problems should be recognized as a priority. 

Fundamental Change - The presence and perception of North and South Omaha can only be improved by first improving the lives of the most vulnerable who are concentrated in North and South Omaha.  Only when those most vulnerable can be elevated to a place of safety and stability which begins with housing and supportive services, can the perception of North and South Omaha improve.

Economic Growth - We expect a continued increase in the population we serve requiring an increase in capacity to serve them.  An investment in additional facilities, staff and services in both North and South Omaha will spur economic growth in jobs created and economic impact as reflected in the Economic Impact section of this application.  The jobs created can be filled by those residing in North and South Omaha to a large extent.  Investment to build capacity to meet demand will result in the creation of excellent job and professional career opportunities as well as an increase in the internship pipeline.  The measure of success will be a reduction in the population seeking our services and an increase in the population elevated into personal stability.  Although what we do is only one step to providing vitality to our local economies, it is the first step and must be accomplished before any local economy can be considered stable. 

Developments like ours proposed in this application will be needed for North and South Omaha to achieve real transformation, change and viable growth.

•	The HERO Rehab will re-energize the South Omaha campus with the rehabilitation of the HERO building.  We have a tremendous waiting list for the HERO facility.  16 years of wear and tear have left the facility in need of physical repair.  And, initially built with a very institutional design, the HERO building needs to be remodeled in a way that is more culturally sensitive and respectful in its layout and function.  
•	Center for Women and Families - To make up for the lack of capacity and to resolve the issue of mixed gender use of the HERO facility, the addition of a new Center for Women and Families will provide opportunities to the most underserved and most vulnerable population in South Omaha.
•	North Omaha Campus - The ability to duplicate facilities and services in North Omaha, where the majority of our client population and other supportive services are concentrated, will provide capacity and balance in serving both North and South Omaha populations.  We have received favorable support from the Siena Francis House and other providers for a North Omaha campus that would complement their services. This proposal will provide investment in physical structures along the 30th Street corridor with safe/affordable quality housing and mental and substance abuse healthcare programming including advocacy, resources and awareness. This proposal will create mixed job opportunities with good wages including high paying professional job opportunities.  This proposal is located in an accessible area close to the community supports and services needed for individuals and families to emerge from homelessness, addiction and mental health crises.</p>

  <p> South Omaha:	13.6 FTE        North Omaha:	68.35 FTE</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> The HERO Rehab alone will create an estimated 75 construction jobs. The construction of a new facility for women and families on the South Omaha campus will create an estimated 100 construction jobs. The construction of an additional new campus built to serve men, women and families will create an estimated 150 new construction jobs in North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Wage levels will vary by construction trade and will range from $25/hr with no benefits for general labor to an estimated $50/hr for the most skilled trades such as electricians.  Benefits paid to employees varies from subcontractor to subcontractor.  Qualified workers and subcontractors living in or near the QCT will be sought out to work on the development.  If National Housing Trust Funds are used, Section 3 will apply requiring best efforts to hire such individuals.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Both projects are located in a QCT.  Local contractors within the area and QCT will be highly encouraged to bid the project.  Additionally, Minority and Women Owned businesses will be contacted to bid. If National Housing Trust Funds are a source, Section 3 will apply, and local individuals will be sought and hired to work on the development to the greatest extent possible.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The devastating economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in our North and South Omaha communities are profound and without this once-in-a-lifetime investment, growth and expansion are not possible.  The misunderstanding of mental health, homelessness, addiction and poverty are generational obstacles and the positive results from the Stephen Center’s Shelter and programs, significantly impacts the livability and viability of the community.  
On 9/26/2022 SAMSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) released the following, Recovery Housing provides “connection, support, sobriety, employment, and quality of life—these are all significant outcomes for people in recovery.  Recovery, being unique to each person, warrants a range of housing options for people, whether they are transitioning from homelessness, a treatment facility, or even their own home.  Continuums of affordable housing models from Housing First to Recovery Housing are invaluable to people in recovery from all walks of life”.
The Stephen Center has been serving the community since 1984.  Established as a 501(c)(3) in December of 1983, the organization was founded by Sharon and Dick McNeil, who recognized a distinct need to assist those living in poverty in south Omaha.  The name Stephen Center was chosen in honor of the Apostle Stephen, one of the first Deacons of the church and a man of faith who committed his time to giving food and charitable aid to the poor. The Stephen Center serves individuals and families caught in the chronic cycle of homelessness, poverty and substance abuse seeking to live in a supportive, positive, sober-living community. 

Of the homeless service providers in Omaha, Stephen Center is most similar to Siena Francis House and Open Door Mission, providing emergency shelter, meals, addiction recovery, and permanent supportive housing. However, Stephen Center is unique in several ways. First, the organization fills a niche for “recovery housing” by maintaining a substance-free environment. Program participants must be drug and alcohol-free and committed to sobriety while living on campus. Stephen Center has found that client success rates increase when provided the option to enter programs providing a structured, safe and sober environment. Second, Stephen Center is the only emergency shelter with a state-licensed addiction recovery program on campus, providing the community’s most vulnerable homeless men and women with mental health and substance abuse recovery programming, free of charge. Supportive Services are provided by the Stephens Center and include case management, basic needs support, i.e. personal items and food, medical care on campus, and linkage to community services for mental health, transportation and other needs.  
Arch Icon Development Corporation considers it an honor to be chosen as Stephen Center’s partner with this historic opportunity expansion to meet the housing / mental health / addiction and poverty needs within the disadvantaged community of North and South Omaha.  The development directly aligns with Arch Icon’s Mission of Restoring Neighborhoods / Revitalizing Communities.  Arch Icon most recently brainstormed and developed “tiny homes” for the Siena Francis House (The Cottages by Siena Francis) and developed the housing and supportive service facilities for the Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition.  Additional, similar partnerships are being formed for developments the metro area.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The development proposal contributes to the community sustainability by providing quality, affordable housing options in North and South Omaha.  The displaced population from the Covid-19 pandemic has drastically increased and this development contributes directly and immediately to their quality of life.  The supportive service programs provided not only address mental health issues but can help reintroduce these community members to the work-force, sense of community, volunteerism and the ultimate goal of a home.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Stephen Center is a CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) accredited organization in all the programming provided on the South Omaha campus; the proposed North Omaha campus would utilize the same practices. According to CARF, “Accreditation signals a service provider’s commitment to continually improving services, encouraging feedback, and serving the community.  CARF accreditation represents the highest level that an organization can receive”.  Stephen Center’s HERO program has been CARF nationally accredited since 2010 undergoing a rigorous review process every three years.  In the fall of 2019, Stephen Center pursued and obtained a three-year CARF accreditation not only for the HERO program, but for the Emergency Shelter and Permanent Supportive Housing programs for the first time. The shelter is now the only CARF accredited homeless shelter in the state.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Stephen Center’s proposal will create new job opportunities in both North and South Omaha with the following increase in permanent positions: South Omaha:	13.6 FTE would provide $509.4K of annual economic impact. North Omaha:	68.35 FTE would provide an estimated $3,041,500 of annual economic impact. Stephen Center North Omaha “proposal would create new jobs with meaningful wages…and create transformational, long-lasting economic growth, and fundamental positive changes”.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Stephen Center would measure and report on the outcomes regarding permanent employment including high paying professional positions.  The transformational, long-lasting economic growth and fundamental positive change could be measured by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce/Nebraska Department of Economic Development.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> The South Omaha proposal would bring an investment of an estimated $17,688,500 in the construction and rehabilitation on the South campus with approximately $9,100,000 from sources outside of this funding such as “private investment” and other grant opportunities.  Once constructed the proposal would fund approximately an additional 68 new FTE positions providing jobs accessible to all individuals including high paying professional opportunities over $60K per year.  The economic impact of these wages is estimated at $3,041,500 annually.   The North Omaha proposal would bring an investment of an estimated $27 million in the construction of a North campus with approximately $13 million from sources outside of this funding such as “private investment” and other grant opportunities.  Once constructed the proposal would fund approximately 13.6 new FTE positions providing jobs accessible to all individuals including high paying professional opportunities over $60K per year.  The economic impact of these wages is estimated at $$509.4K annually.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Stephen Center’s partner organization and volunteers that assist with programming and supports on the South Campus would be utilized in the proposed Female/Family HERO facility.  These partners and volunteers provide over 30,000 hours annually which has a conservative impact of over $500K annually.  With the proposed North Campus, these partners would be utilized in providing the additional support and services. In addition, Stephen Center would look to expand partnerships with organizations such as No More Empty Pots, Habitat for Humanity, and Charles Drew Health Center.   The following is a partial list of Stephen Center’s community partners: Community Alliance, Saving Grace, Siena Francis, Completely Kids, Heart Ministry Center, One World Health Center, Visiting Nurses Association, Omaha Housing Authority, Region VI Behavioral Health, Creighton University, College of St. Mary's, Bellevue University, University of Nebraska-Omaha, Douglas County Drug Court, Dodge County Drug Court, Pottawattamie Drug Court, Sarpy Drug Court Saunders Drug Court, Metropolitan Community College, Heartland Family Services, Lutheran Family Services.
