  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Community-Based Doula service connects underserved pregnant women to other women in their communities who are specially trained as doulas to provide support during the critical times of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum/early parenting. The program is based on the power of peer-to-peer support. Because doulas are of and from the same community as their clients, they can understand language and cultural needs and create long-term links to support networks. 

Doulas are non-physician healthcare providers that aid the delivery of babies and care of the mother. Players in the Doula industry basically offer care to childbearing women during their pregnancy, labor and during the postpartum period. They may also help care for the newborn through six weeks of age, including assisting the mother with breastfeeding. The Doula industry is indeed a very massive industry in the U.S. and reliable statistics has it that in the United States of America, the industry is worth $3 billion, with an estimated growth rate of 2.8 percent between 2015 and 2022. There are about 17,246 registered and licensed doulas service providers in the United States, and they are responsible for employing about 22,058 people. It is important to state that this industry has no major players with a market share of greater than 5 percent.

Furthermore, demand for industry services has expanded due to the ability of doulas to reduce costs associated with pregnancy and birthing. Overall, industry revenue is anticipated to increase during the current period. For example, medical licensure creates a barrier to entry in the healthcare sector. If one is determined and ready to go all the way, they will surely succeed in establishing a doula services business in the United States of America and will be glad they did because it is indeed a profitable line of business.

The goal is to be located in the North Omaha Area servicing predominantly BIWOC (Black Indigenous Women of Color) by 2025 or sooner.</p>
