  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 9602944.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 9602944.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program
Service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Lion’s gate provides fully equipped, highly qualified and trained security services for crowd control, security, and armed and unarmed protection service to ensure a safe and lawful environment at venues. We will provide both vehicular and foot patrol which provides for flexibility in scheduling security. We will respond to all emergency calls and interface with the Omaha Police, Fire and Emergency Services in order to coordinate their response. This will negate having to call police and EMS for non-emergency by responding to the initial incident and relay pertinent information to responding units.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> The timeline for Lion’s Gate’s start of security services should begin when Prime construction companies break ground and bring equipment on the construction site.
Our security services will continue from ground breaking to managing ongoing security services once the project is up and running</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> At a minimum this proposal will be Transformational because no other entity of this magnitude exists in the black community and it is possible because of the background and expertise that we bring in the public safety arena.
Long lasting economical growth is possible because employees will be working and living in the area that they will be purchasing goods and services
Sustainable community can be possible because our success will result in permanent high paying jobs.
Other infrastructure such as multi-use projects can use the same model in order to made those community achieve similar results</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our Proposal addresses the high unemployment rates in North Omaha as well as low wages from low paying non career jobs. We are providing local investment in the community, by currently pumping over a million dollars annually of our payroll in the 68111,68104 and 68110 zip codes. This proposal will give us the opportunity to increase our  commercial presence in the community by expanding our current operations and establishing a high profile national headquarters in North Omaha.

Our Cyber Security Training will address the 30% dropout rate of African Americans in the OPS school system. This will be another pathway for non-college grads to transition into high tech entry level jobs that will pay a high wage.

Our Non emergency transportation will expand our current Emergency Medical Response Service by providing transportation to Seniors and low income individuals in the north Omaha Area that have limited access to transportation services to get to their medical appointments, need wheelchair transportation in a timely manner and need transportation to access personal services such as hair dresser of recreation.

Our expansion into providing firearms training and associated sales of firearms gear is born out of the last 10 years of providing concealed carry certification classes for North Omaha residents. The numbers of students and the increased interest in participation in the firearms culture has necessitated us to provide our citizens a more inclusive and comfortable opportunity to enter into this lifestyle by building a firearms range in our community. This as other sports or hobbies have never been available to our residents in a situation that they feel more comfortable in.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Lion’s Gate has been aggressive in developing partnerships from within the black community as well as with other successful companies outside the North Omaha Community
The economic impact of our presence in the North Omaha Area is that we can directly affect the economic condition of the area by hiring people that live within blocks of our proposed facility thereby keeping local payroll dollars in that confined area and have more opportunity for those dollars to circulate in North Omaha before leaving.
We provide innovation by expanding our services in installing Video surveillance systems, access control systems, Security alarm systems as well as provide training for our employees in these areas.
We have made a conscious decision to convert our current fleet of vehicles to electric vehicles. We are proposing installing a high powered EV charging station on our premises in order to draw outside customers to out area. This charging station is on a national network and will produce income.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Anticipated that we will hire and train a security team of 45 unarmed uniformed security officers and 25 armed uniformed officers with salaries ranging from $15 to $25 dollars. These are permanent positions. Part time and full time</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 50 permenant jobs will be created with this proposal</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 45 temporary construction entry level construction security jobs will be created</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> The entry level wages will start at $15 per hour up to $20 PER HOUR</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Hiring will begin as soon as the first piece of construction equipment is placed on the construction site. This will provide immediate employment for local residents rather than wait until the end of the project</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Community will benefit by us hiring people from the community working in the community and getting higher salaries, and keeping those salary dollars in the community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Sustainability will be obtained by improving quality of life by giving community employees a living wage that can be life changing and foster higher self esteem by providing a professional and respectable profession.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> lions Gate Security Solutions Inc., since it’s inception has been on the cutting edge of technology by incorporating security guard services with changing technology. We have high tech services such as Access control, security system installation, camera systems and magnetometers. These technologies have been innovative in the security industry by elevating the skill level of our security officers</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The outcomes that we will measure our proposal by will be by improving the relationship between the police department and contract security by being a partner and liaison with law enforcement and public safety. We currently provide that model of service as a contract security entity that works in the old market and downtown district.Our relationship with Omaha police and administrative officials has made this long-term partnership successful</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The outcome will be measured be the number of incidents that we as a security contractor can respond to and document the disposition. This would minimize calling Omaha Police Department for low level or non law enforcement calls. Statistics can be available to adjust manning levels to address higher profile times and locations</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> This model proposal can be a catalyst for secondary investment by using this model of public safety services in other locations being developed as multi-use areas that cannot depend on public safety services to provide wrap around security and safety for those communities</p>

  <h3>GeneralContractorPublicCompetitiveBidWhyNot</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The amount of our proposal is $9,602,944.00 million dollars.
The rationale for the dollar amount is because multiple services are contained in one facility to make it multi-use. This is more economical that proposing multiple buildings in separate locations. The main facility will provide the majority of our expanded services and the Shooting range will be adjoined as an expansion to the main building with a separate public entrance. The two facilities 
Will be connected to each other with a secured doorway</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The funds will provide a turnkey Public Safety service that will provide security and safety services, transportation and technology training to the community. This will be an immediate impact on the community because security services can be deployed as soon as construction equipment in placed on the site. We can employ people right away as apposed to waiting until after all of the construction is complete.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The fiscal operation for this proposal will be separated from our current multi-state presence for the purpose of transparency and the ability to separate specific services to North Omaha in order to track our progress and our adherence to this LB1024 initiative.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> This project is scalable as it relates to growing security services to reflect the increase in new businesses moving into the service area. Most new initiatives are focused on the multi-use concept. This concept can be adopted by those areas</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> NEMT Service is a non emergency transport service that will focus on North Omaha elderly or low income who need readily avaible rides to medical appointments, Shopping and personal services. No current services are specifically targeted to the North Omaha area. These services have a private pat component as well as being reinbursed by Medicaide and Medicare. Cyber Security Training will have an enrollment fee. Some scholarships will be available. Security Services will be provided to the target area on an ongoing basis and produce a profit. Fire arms is a fast increasing hobby and cultural interest in the black community. This firearms range will expose more North Omaha residents to the culture as well as provide fire arms safety training. FIrearms sales as well as shooting gear will be available to market and sell.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Once the proposed project is completed, we will assume all financial responsibly for the continuance to business.
Each component will be profitable after the first year of operations.
-Public Safety Service- Will be profitable by providing security services out of the proposed headquarters. We will also contribute to the economy by hiring local residents.
- Cybersecurity Training- Will be profitable by charging a fee for students. Some scholarships will be available.
- NEMT Transport- Our Transportation service will contract with medicare and medicaid. There will also be private transportation opportunities as well
- Firearms Ranges are a fast growing industry and is very profitable for training, equipment and firearms purchases as well as a fast growing hobby among African Americans.</p>
