  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Celebration of Life Mortuary & Crematory will offer comprehensive services to bereaved family in the Omaha metro area.  These services will include pre-planning, burial, crematory, emergency freezing, drive thru viewing, written programs/obituary, music programming, pre-planning and culinary.  Additionally, there are plans for a banquet hall for repass dinners and receptions for families to receive friends and family without having to prepare or arrange these services at an alternate location.  We will offer comprehensive packages for full- service instead of an a la carte fashion.  Our vision is to develop and have a one stop facility with exceptional customer service all while taking the preparatory burden and emotional turmoil from the family and loved ones left to make these heartfelt arrangements.  We are conceptualizing this location to become a location which will provide ease, professionalism, multi-services all while giving thought to socio economic constraints, diversity and understanding to the bereaved clients.  A faith centered organization centered in North Omaha where there is no full-service mortuary of its kind; that understands the cultural differences of varied ethnicities. Our comprehensive vision is to also offer after care services such as grief counseling which will enable families to resume their lives while healing from the loss of family and building of mental health while mourning.  This additional concept and service will add additional employment opportunities in the Omaha area.   We plan to staff those well experienced in the industry while providing the opportunity for internships and development to those who desire to assist families through these difficult times and build long lasting employment in the various areas of service offered.  We further see this business being a community partner by offering internships to those students studying mortuary sciences, graphic design, management and pastoral care with partnerships at the local colleges, universities and community colleges in our area.  There is a need for this type of business in North Omaha but also there is a need to understand the cultural diversities which accompany bereaved families whose expectations concerning services are not well met at other facilities.</p>
