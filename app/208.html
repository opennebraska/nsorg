  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Fire Station 14 has a long and illustrious history in the city of Omaha. It was the last firehouse to be segregated in Omaha, and it is now home to the Omaha Association of Black Professional Fire Fighters. The Fire Station 14 Redevelopment Project seeks to use the building as a talent pipeline for minority job seekers interested in firefighting, policing, emergency medical services, and nursing. We also intend to start a coffee house and food incubator for budding entrepreneurs. This project includes extending the second floor and adding rooftop permaculture to provide North Omaha with more access to nutritious year-round meals.

Our city needs to become more inclusive in order to survive. This is because we are facing a worker shortage. Many first responders are reaching retirement age. We may alleviate this problem by providing minority applicants with chances through initiatives like Fire Station 14, which would help us meet the impending worker shortages in emergency services.

This new hub celebrates the tradition of black firefighters in Omaha, which started over a century ago with Dr. Mathew Oliver Ricketts. In 1895, he not only requested the first African-American firefighters be hired by the city but was also later elected as the first African-American to Nebraska Legislature and graduated from what is now the University of Nebraska Medical Center - making him UNMC's first African-American graduate.

Our goal is to partner with Metropolitan Community College and iEXCEL at UNMC so that we can attract people of all ages, from all backgrounds, into the building. We will use cutting-edge technologies like AR/VR simulation to provide experiences that would not only teach these youngsters more about these vital professions but also help experienced professionals update their skills according to current best practices and standards.

We understand how crucial education is and want to offer educational opportunities to our community. This would begin with new applicants, all the way up to promotional chances for current members. By having this "satellite" program in North Omaha, it might encourage locals who don't have easy access to Irvington or South Omaha classes, to attend them here.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Remodel will be completed within 18 months of securing funding. We will put out an RFP to qualified companies upon approval of funding and begin preparing the site for construction by the end of summer 2023 with the bulk of the exterior work starting in spring of 2024.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This building renovation is about so much more than just the physical structure. We're using this project as a platform to generate jobs and progress for underrepresented citizens, and to allow North Omaha locals access to healthy food options and business growth opportunities they might not otherwise have.

The Fire Station 14 Redevelopment Project strives to provide a talent pipeline for minority job seekers who have an interest in firefighting, policing, emergency medical services and nursing. We also plan to open a coffee house and food incubator for entrepreneurs. This project will include extending the second floor and adding rooftop permaculture which will give North Omaha more access to nutritious year-round meals.

The main floor will be turned into usable community space, including a coffee shop incubator to teach startup entrepreneurs how to run a service business, and the firehouse kitchen will be updated to a code-compliant commercial kitchen. With an adaptable area for trainings and immersive technology for career exposure, the property will be made ADA and code compliant. Our plan for the 1,840sf partial basement is to use it as a public assembly space where community members can collaborate and take advantage of the new technology being brought in. We hope to add a second floor above the main floor to replace some of the space that was removed previously, and on the roof we would like to add permaculture so that people have year-round access to healthy food.

Our goal is to partner with Metropolitan Community College and iEXCEL at UNMC so that we can attract people of all ages, from all backgrounds, into the building. We will use cutting-edge technologies like AR/VR simulation to provide experiences that would not only teach these youngsters more about these vital professions but also help experienced professionals update their skills according to current best practices and standards. With this new program, not only will kids have a chance to learn and receive an education, but current professional staff will also be given more opportunities for growth and advancement.

Opening an innovative career center in North Omaha, we may assist to energize, recharge, and propel important changes in the area. We're not just changing North Omaha's presence and reputation throughout the region; we're also restoring its excitement by renovating Fire Station 14. The adaptive design of our cutting-edge reuse of a historical structure will establish a new bar for architecture in North Omaha.

If we develop this project correctly, it has the potential to serve as a talent pipeline for underrepresented minorities seeking jobs in fields like firefighting, policing, emergency medical services and nursing. Not only that, but it would also provide new spaces for Entrepreneurs just starting out. These are well-paying occupations That will generate generational wealth and stimulate further North Omaha's historic core.

By providing good job options to people in North Omaha, we not only help improve their financial situations, but also the city as a whole. Sustainability comes from within, and by offering these positions to individuals who would excel in them, we are giving back while securing our future. We are making North Omaha multimodel by creating a neighborhood hub where entrepreneurs can learn how to operate a business while serving an underserved community. We are improving access to broadband technologies by providing opportunities for public safety training and technology education via broadband, satellite, or 5g. This will allow for new space dedicated to community gatherings, public safety employment possibilities for minority candidates, and healthier food options--Improving local policy and resolving some of North Omaha's accessibility issues.</p>

This will create new civic space and new educational opportunities for the community. The redevelopment of Fire Station 14 will also improve the quality of life for the people who live nearby, including space for community gatherings, job opportunities, access to healthy food options and educational resources to allow access to public safety careers.

This project also fits within the cultural context of north Omaha as it is aimed at improving minority representation in firefighting, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and nursing careers. By providing cutting-edge experiences that will teach them about these vital professions, we hope to encourage more people from this community to access these careers.</p>

This proposal will also be providing incubator space for small businesses. This will provide entrepreneurs with the opportunity to learn how to operate a service business in a residential area. In addition, the project will promote street activity and make the community safer and healthier by providing a destination that is accessible via public transit, walking, or cycling. This will make the community more multi-modal as it encourages people to walk and cycle by offering a destination that is entirely accessible from a residential area. Finally, the project will improve broadband connectivity by providing simulation and emerging technology education.</p>

We anticipate increasing minority representation in these first responder careers by 10%, which will create long-term employment for members of the community. These are well-paying occupations that will generate generational wealth and stimulate further financial investment in North Omaha's historic core.
