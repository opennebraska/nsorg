  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> We restored the North Omaha YMCA and transformed it into where Jesuit Academy is today 26 years ago, keeping the integrity of the history and expanding it to change the trajectory of young men in North Omaha through education. Once we did that, we have acquired the land around us in order to get to this point. 3 years ago we went through a million dollar renovation of our 6 internal classrooms.</p>

  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> Double the Impact at Jesuit Academy</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 26390000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 9300000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Jesuit Academy is all boys 4th - 8th grade school located in North Omaha at 2311 N. 22nd Street. We serve students we are at or below the poverty line and live in the North Omaha zipcodes. We are looking to transform and double the impact of the students we serve by building and renovating to not have 75 students but 150 students. We currently graduate 15 students a year and promise each student/family that we will change the trajectory of their lives by continuing to follow the student from 4th grade through when they get their first job. This new initiative could help the long term growth of North Omaha by having now 30 students getting a better education with more resources to come back and give back to the community they received their education from. We have a 98% high school graduation rate that in Omaha for an African American young man is unheard of that great of success. We are looking to create lasting impact and transform the young men of North Omaha through education. Through this a new expansion of building, more teaching positions available and more students we serve we could complete this by July of 2024 and double the impact and trajectory of the students we serve in North Omaha.</p>
