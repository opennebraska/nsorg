  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition (NUIHC) has been serving the urban Indian community in Omaha since 1986. Our mission is to elevate the health status of Urban Indians and other underserved populations. We address health disparities through education, collaboration, advocacy and health service delivery.

Years in the making, we recently completed the building of our Eagle Heights Campus in South Omaha. Altogether a $16 million dollar project, this included a 44-unit Affordable Housing Project and our Services Building. This has been a huge goal for NUIHC to further our transformative efforts in the Native community.

● In 2020, we completed our Eagle Heights Affordable Housing project. Located at 4834 S 23rd Street in historic South Omaha, Eagle Heights is a 44-unit building funded through tax credits.

The goal of this project was to transform the lives of our community members by providing expansion of social services in combination with the addition of NUIHC Services Building across the street. In partnership with the City of Omaha, we developed and implemented the Ready to Rent Program, an adult learning classroom inspired principle in housing readiness education to prepare future applicants for EH housing and beyond.

● In 2022, we completed the renovation of the NUIHC Services Building. Located at 2226 N Street, we offer inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment, health clinic, youth and elder programs. The renovation was funded through various generous local foundations.

This proposal would take us one step further in our efforts to advocate for the Native Community.</p>

  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> Eagle Heights Umoⁿhoⁿ Park</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 636215.37</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 636215.37</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> We acknowledge that Omaha is the traditional land of the Umoⁿhoⁿ people. We honor the Indigenous people of America, all elders; past, present, and emerging. We are called on to learn and share what we learn about the tribal history, culture, and contributions that have been suppressed in telling the story of America.

We would like to propose to build a park that would be an extension of our Eagle Heights campus in South Omaha. This park would honor our Native community with beautiful Native art installations, gardens and an Inipi (a Sweat Lodge) that would be used by our Native community. We would also like to include a small area to allow for parking. 

We are looking at parcels of land in the area of 5214 S 16th Street in Omaha. If awarded this grant, we would commence the property acquisition process and conceptual design early in 2023 and complete by the end of the same year.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The properties that we are looking at have no plans to be developed by the existing property owners.  We would make it into a beautiful space that would both honor the Native community as well as provide a much needed Sweat Lodge for our Native brothers and sisters who currently have to drive long distances to participate in what can be compared to many as going to "church".</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This development would provide more representation for our Native community while enhancing and beautifying the city.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal would be transformative for the Native community who have felt their erasure for centuries. It would be representative of the often forgotten about members of the community that are still here. This park would be an extension of NUIHC's Eagle Heights campus and provide the clients we serve and to have a place to be and enjoy the beauty of their surroundings.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> NUIHC would maintain the park and would employ contractors and possibly add employees in the future to do so.</p>
