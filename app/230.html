  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Bringing the Calibri (Body) Life Saving Care of CPR to the North Omaha Community 

Economic Impact: This proposal creates jobs for 3-CPR instructors; with additional jobs as the program grows. Instructors typically earn $75-100 for each 3-hour Basic Life Support program. 

Community benefit. The North Omaha community lacks access to trained CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) instructors, trained volunteers, and automatic external defibrillators (AEDs). Lives are needlessly lost every day. There are no training programs within the community. This proposal begins to address this problem in a sustainable way with positive economic impact. 

Best Practices: The American Heart Association (AHA) has the evidence-based program that shows CPR done in the community has the highest effectiveness in saving lives and will be implemented as part of this proposal (https://www.pdfdrive.com/bls-provider-manual-e58720911.html). The applicant (Latsha Griffin) has advanced training, experience, and certification to implement the AHA program for our community. 

Outcome Measure: The main outcome measures are the number of (1) trained instructors and (2) trained volunteers.  The Project Director (LG) will report and document these outcomes as completed certifications. We anticipate applying for additional grant support to place AEDs in key locations like libraries, grocery storesâ€¦. Or these locations may themselves make those investments in community safety. The number of AEDs at key community sites is an additional reportable outcome. 

Partnerships: The Project Director, LG, has an established role as a CPR instructor at The National Safety Council for 4 years and currently with American Heart Association   

Displacement: Not Applicable. 

Location: As part of this proposal, we request funds to rent space in a central location to the census tracts served. During the funding period we will identify a community partner to permanently house the program. With the ability to grow and expand 

Qualified Census Tract: this should be in the legislation</p>
