  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 0.63</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Recreation: My business would include a district of other businesses as well. I'd have a space akin a room designated for events and get together in a private setting.

Broadband would be available to the guests that are using our services

Quality of life would be inherent to help people feel safe as they eat and work in the space. We would also have plain clothes security on staff as well

end quote</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Connect North Omaha to downtown by creating a sustainable, safe space for the two areas to blur during the nighttime. 

Making sure that people in the greater Omaha community can access the space safely. Sustainability comes in a Wakonda-like futuristic sense mirroring a solar power storm proof that doesn't lose electricity and never powers down, i.e. Babcock Ranch in Fort Myers Florida.

end quote</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> My proposal aligns with the strategic priorities because it will:

1)  fulfill the walkability (via solar energy powered walkways at night)

2) during storms the electricity will remain on allowing for internet and connectivity services allowing others from the greater Omaha community to migrate to North O (in turn creating trust and confidence for a community to meet the needs during crisis-- i.e. dependability=survivals

3. Displacement dissolved because within my business model training is the core to building one up to meet the needs of the future (business acumen and mentorship and development is part of 10% of job function)

4. line blurred between North Omaha and Downtown by using recyclable items for infrastructure building- via seeking out minority talents at schools that bottom tier black talent

5. allow community members to participate in and lead microprojects of their own with micro-funding (2-3% of business capital proceeds go to micro-projects in community) i.e. recycle dollars

6. recycled dollars used to support plans that align with strategic priorities end quote</p>
