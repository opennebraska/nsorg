  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> I became a business owner, because this symbolizes everything I am, and everything I have wanted to be as a woman. We as women go through so many changes throughout our lives. However, one thing that proves to be constant is the struggle to find balance. Now, imagine trying to navigate these spaces as a woman of color. It is extremely difficult, especially when everything is catered to women, who don’t look like you or me. When you turn on the television,
or scroll through social media, there are these constant images of lifestyles that seem unattainable for women of color. We know that this isn’t the case, as there have been many before me, and many after me, that will change this status quo. Brittany’s Balance would like to launch an app to better serve the community. Followed by hosting a series of bootcamps, workshops, support groups to help promote health and wellness for women of color. An app to make wellness accessible to all. This will make my business national which helps with job creation.</p>
