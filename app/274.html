  <p> Union Omaha History

In its inaugural season in 2020, Union Omaha announced itself to the rest of USL League One not just by leading the league in attendance, but by finishing the season as a league finalist. Union Omaha then followed up on its stellar organizational performance by repeating its performance in attendance and finishing as League One champions in 2021. By demonstrating strength on the field and in the stands, Union Omaha has already made itself known as a strong organization deserving of the support of its community. 

“One Means All”

The team motto promotes diversity and inclusion on the field, in the grandstands, and in the community.</p>

  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> Omaha Multi-Use Stadium Grant Request</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 100000000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 50000000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The proposed funds would be used to fund part of the construction costs associated with a 7,000-seat, multi-use, rectangular stadium. The stadium would anchor a mixed-use development.
The 2021 USL League One Champions, Union Omaha, will be the primary tenant at the stadium. In addition to Union Omaha, the stadium would host concerts, festivals, community events, high-school sports, collegiate sports, U.S. Open Cup games and international friendly matches. Our projections expect around 160 events annually in the stadium, at stabilization. 
This project will be transformative for the City of Omaha and the State of Nebraska. In addition to the construction jobs from the project, we would anticipate an influx of jobs to support the operations of the stadium. We intend to deploy as many North and South Omaha contractors in the construction process. The stadium will accelerate and drive traffic to the retail and hospitality offerings. The first phase of the development will be over $150 million in private investment including a hotel, retail, and multi-family residential. The second phase will bring total private investment over $300 million. 
The funding plan for the Stadium calls for contributions from the Sports Facility Financing Assistance Act, the formation of an Enhanced Employment Area district, TIF Funding, assistance from the City Capital Improvements Program, funding from other State grants, philanthropic dollars, and private dollars from Union Omaha. 
The stadium is planned to open in the Spring of 2025. To meet this deadline, construction needs to begin in January of 2024. Design is expected to be complete in May of 2023, with infrastructure and site preparation following immediately thereafter. Project funding needs to be secured and finalized by the end of June 2023. 
The planned development would occur South of Seward Street, North of Cuming Street, and East of 16th Street. The Stadium is proposed to go into the NE corner of the development.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The total project cost is $100 million. We see $50 million in funding coming from LB1024 as part of the Public-Private Partnership required to get this Stadium project completed.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> LB1024’s Grant funding will be used to pay hard construction costs and other costs associated with the construction of the Stadium, including softs costs and land acquisition.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> If awarded funding, the project would be fiscally sustainable. Union Omaha will operate the stadium and cover the cost of operations. Furthermore, our budget has built-in soft costs, a project contingency, and escalation to protect from cost overruns.  The 1024 grant funding will be part of an overall funding plan to pay for the construction of the Stadium. After the initial investment, Union Omaha will operate the stadium and cover the costs of operations. Part of the operations plan calls for Union Omaha to create a capital expenditures fund that is paid into each year to help cover the cost of future maintenance.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Our proposed capital stack includes funding from the City of Omaha from EEA turnback. The proposed project also accounts for funding from the City Capital Improvement Program. The proposal also calls for turnback through the State’s Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act. Lastly, we are exploring the possibilities of a one-time grant from the State’s cash reserve fund.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> State, SAFFAA Turnback, Pending, June 2023  State, Cash Reserve Drawdown, Pending, June 2023  City, Creation of EEA District, Pending, March 2023  City, CIP, Pending March 2023</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> This proposal will not be able to continue without the turnback from the EEA District or the turnback through the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> This proposal is not scalable. The stadium needs to be completed to design to ensure the greatest economic impact for the community.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The team will lease the stadium and pay an annual rent to play in the stadium. These rent payments will be bonded against and will contribute roughly $6,000,000 to the capital stack.</p>
