  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Abide is a non-profit organization dedicated to the elimination of inner cities. Abide began in 1989 and focuses on a strategy of building safer neighborhoods, growing stronger families, and developing emerging leaders. Their vision is that there would be no place in Omaha, NE defined by “redlines” or “red dots”. In the Omaha areas where Abide has helped establish a lighthouse, crime dropped an average of 75%. Lighthouses are strategically placed homes in North Omaha with the intention of uniting the people in a neighborhood. Families who reside in the lighthouses connect with neighbors relationally on a weekly basis, plan and host block parties, and work to clean up the neighborhood. Abide also operates a food bank serving the local area.</p>

  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> Abide Space Renovation</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 175000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 125000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Inner cities are facing unprecedented challenges. Cycles of poverty and crime ravage the lives of the next generation. Often, residents of inner city areas feel hopeless and alone. They have not been given the same opportunities to thrive and do not know the path to take so they resort to crime. The best way to prevent crime and poverty is not to incarcerate or discuss solutions, it is to come alongside residents in the neighborhoods and act as a resource. Beyond its campus in North Omaha, Abide also places families in neighborhoods to live with the residents through the Lighthouse Program. These neighborhood leaders meet multiple times a year and connect with a Lighthouse Coordinator provided by Abide. The campus is used as a meeting space to coordinate efforts pushed at a community level like this program. The money from the LB10204 grant would be used to renovate and furnish a space on the Abide Better Together campus (3223 North 45th Street, Omaha, NE 68104). This space will be used for leadership training, entrepreneurship training, conference space, and small events. In addition, this space will be used for collaboration between other North Omaha organizations. This collaboration allows these additional organizations who might otherwise be too small to have space without high rental costs to meet and form strategic partnerships that better use limited resources to reach the people in their community. The grant will not be used to start a new program with a hope of success; it would be used to expand a proven program with a history of success so that it can reach more people. Training and mentoring increases wealth in the community and reduces crime. Abide is positioned to start the renovation immediately upon award of the grant.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Renovation of the space can begin immediately. The space will need some design support for equipment repairs, however, much of the work can begin immediately. Completion is anticipated by Winter of 2023.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 0.98</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> When people who live and work in the area have a vested interest in the success of the community, they will be more likely to support the local community efforts and avoid crime. There is a shift in cleanliness and society in areas with local ownership along with a decrease in poverty and crime. Abide works with local communities to engage people and create a connection between residents. Through their food pantry, counseling, mentoring, and training, Abide strives to reach people where they are and meet their physical and mental needs. When a Lighthouse is established to reach residents, Abide ensures the leaders have regular meetings for training and connection. Events are also planned in these meetings. Abide works to reduce crime and create economic growth with an overall goal to end inner cities initially created by through the practice of redlining. This meeting space would allow Abide to continue to expand efforts like the Lighthouse Project by providing places for leaders meet, train, and support each other. The area could be used for planning other similar endeavors or providing organizations with similar goals a place to gather.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Some of the weaknesses listed in the SWOT analysis from the Public Engagement Summary for North Omaha include:
	Lack of community cohesiveness and consensus.
	Private funding rarely takes community ownership and input into account.
	Economic investment does not recycle within the community.
	Financial literacy and access.
	Lack of connected businesses economically.
	Lack of investment.
	Lack of responsibility for community conditions and economic resources.
	Lack of jobs.
	Lack of for-profit business.
Abide is a local North Omaha organization bringing people into North Omaha. Abide encourages outside people to spend money in the area and build local businesses up. Abide works with neighborhoods and residents to build community and support each other.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024 Section 4(2) states that the grant money shall be distributed with an emphasis on “assistance for small businesses, job training, and business development within such communities and neighborhoods.” Abide is an organization focusing on helping residents in North Omaha. They provide the training and business development assistance to help initiate small businesses.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The grant money from LB1024 would not directly create business beyond the construction cost to local contractors. The largest benefit is that the money would allow Abide to train others so that they can create businesses. The money is not a one-time benefit to a select group of people; it is the seed that allows a wide reach empowering others to create jobs. These are people who create a domino effect on others to help create jobs, recycle investment, and support local growth.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> This space will be utilized to meet and support residents.  Jobs created would be though improving communities and supporting people.  There are not direct jobs created, but the transformational change will create jobs over time.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Construction will use existing North Omaha companies or individuals.  The number of jobs created temporarily for construction is unknown.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> unknown</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Reduction in crime and supporting residents will create more business opportunity and reduce the state risk/cost associated with fighting crime.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Abide strives to make each community self-sustainable. Poverty and inner cities cannot be eradicated unless each community is self-sustained. This is accomplished when people feel safe, kids are fed and schooled, and families are intact and working. Abide works diligently in all these areas though their food bank, Lighthouses, and other programs to reach the residents.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The success of these programs can be seen by the reduction of crime in neighborhoods with a Lighthouse.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Abide brings a new and innovative, yet proven plan to the problem of the community separation and educational/economical poverty rampant in North Omaha. Abide’s novel approach reaches people where they are and shows support. When someone is willing to live and work with residents, there is a level of trust not gained from those who sit in a remote location and direct from afar. Abide’s track-record proves the success of the tactic and demonstrates progress where prior attempts have failed.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Abide measures success in multiple ways. One of the largest indicators of success has been a reduction in crime. Violent crimes affect at least two people. Both the victim and the perpetrator are impacted. By reducing each crime at least two people are saved which, in turn, affects their families and loved ones. Transforming people who would commit the crimes also creates citizens who support and build others up. By reducing crime, Abide helps to lower unemployment and recycle money in the North Omaha economy.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> These outcomes are not only measured by Abide, but they can be seen and documented by the Omaha Police Department.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Abide has not only received investment, but they invest in the community through training, support, and the food back.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Abide has been partnering with local churches. Donations come in the forms of funding, time, and effort.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Abide is financially sustainable. Abide is a donation-supported charity that began in 1989 and has had a strong presence in the city ever since. Abide receives charitable donations and operates on a net zero budget. This renovation will enhance and expand existing programs taking place on the Better Together campus.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Abide has not applied for any other grants or funding at this time.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Without this funding, Abide will continue to operate and will slowly renovate the space over time.  The renovation may be scaled back and the speed at which people can be trained will be slowed, but the program will continue.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> The request for funding is based upon a single renovation and is not scalable. Any shortfall in funding would require changes in the design or space renovated.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Abide is proposing providing $50,000 for this renovation. This will be accomplished though church fundraising, local business support, or time/resource donations. Abide is a successful organization in Omaha and committed to continuing in Omaha. Omaha is their home, and they are 100% dedicated to providing jobs, hope, and a positive legacy in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
