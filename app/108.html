  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project will take a nuisance to the community-an underutilized and long vacant OOIC building which will be demolished and transform the city block to 160 apartment units, 12 townhomes and 9,000 square feet of ground level retail which will create jobs for individuals that live within the qualified census tract. The project site is located along historic North 24th street and expands upon recent momentum and development along the corridor such as 24th and Lake, 24th and Cuming and the North 24th Street Business Improvement District’s Streetscape Master Plan. 
During the community workshops, a need was expressed to highlight and honor North Omaha heroes. This transformational project on a highly visible corridor owned by Terence “Bud” Crawford will be an additional jewel for the area. 
The proposal expands the number of black owned companies that will attract additional investment in North Omaha and supports recent quality development in proximity to the project site area.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project meets several opportunities and needs identified in the Visioning Workshop for North Omaha . Alignment areas include leveraging vacant parcels, community ownership, replenishing aging inventory, and investments in workforce housing stock.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project aligns with several priorities identified within LB1024 for  North Omaha, including:
-	Responding to deepened existing disparities resulting from the disproportional effects of COVID-19 within low- and moderate-income and minority communities
-	Targeting resources within Qualified Census tracts geographically situated in North and South Omaha
-	Emphasis on targeting a portion of resources toward housing needs and wealth-building among minority populations effected by historical practices such as redlining</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We anticipate permanent jobs to be created with respect to the management and maintenance of the new proposed structure.  In addition, we anticipate hundreds of temporary jobs to be created through the course of construction by various contractors and sub contractors working to build the project.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 200</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> We will pay regional competitive wages for all contractors and design professionals</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> It is a priority of this project to hire contractors located within the communities where these units will be constructed. Specifically, when building in North Omaha, we will seek North Omaha-based contractors.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The direct community benefit of this project will be threefold. First, the project will produce 160 below-market rate opportunities. The 12 townhomes will increase the diversity of housing typology along the corridor. Second, the ground level retail will expand economic opportunity for small and emerging business and create new economic activity for the North 24th street district. Being located on Line 24 of Metro Transit, this route is the systems most used route and has 15 minute frequencies-which will provide residents with easy access to jobs, human services, and educational needs.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> In addition to the benefits listed above, this project will address the need for leveraging vacant properties, as identified in the Visioning Workshops. Revitalizing vacant properties results in increased tax basis for communities, stronger property values for neighboring homes, neighborhood beautification in the removal of unkempt lots, and oftentimes reduced crime activity
Furthermore, investments in housing are correlated with increases in regional economic growth, as well as an increase in overall community health and well-being. As noted in the Affordable Housing Study:
- $8 million in local income and 122 jobs are generated from every 100 units of affordable housing.
- Families in affordable housing are able to spend five times more on healthcare, 30% more on quality food, and two times more on retirement savings.</p>
