  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This program is sustainable by nature because it is an answer a need expressed by entrepreneurs and financial institutions in the greater Omaha area. The need for business education in general and for financial literacy is considerable. We have been working with our partners to answer the entrepreneur community for a few years.

We will increase cooperation with other organizations that have the same purpose to offer more resources to businesses.

We will also contract with financial institutions to provide training for entrepreneurs requesting financing who do not qualify because of poor business acumen.
The program will impact wealth in the community in a positive way by creating job opportunities, hence, reducing poverty. The increase in economic power will be measured by the disposable income generated by the entrepreneurs for their family. The direct signs will be noticed through access to capital, better nutrition, healthcare, education, and wellness.                    
The program will use polls and official historic data to measure its sustainability.</p>
