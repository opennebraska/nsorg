We then plan on helping 101 other families purchase those homes through strategic partnerships with local banks and businesses such American National Bank and Habitat for Humanity. Our plan is to market, find, and acquire single family houses in North Omaha in order to remodel them and help families in need find an affordable home. Our mission is to improve lives in our community one house at time. Grace Home Solutions is owned by an African woman named Ahou Grace Daniele Kouassi who has immigrated to the United States at the age of 16. She has found a passion in helping families in need in the North Omaha community by providing an easy hassle-free process to buy and/or sell their homes. Through this project, we plan on impacting the lives of 500-1000 people given the fact that the average family we plan on helping has 5 members.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We believe that our plan aligns with the visioning workshop summary because of the cultural and economical aspect of our project. 101 Affordable Homes is designed to provide affordable home ownership to families whom otherwise would have never qualified to have anything. We have decided to do it in North Omaha because of the reach cultural</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> We believe our proposal aligns with LB1024 because it will be focused in the main areas LB1024 focuses. It aims at enhancing the quality of lives of the people living in these areas.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We plan on partnering up with local businesses such as Luna Construx and Rooforia.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> We believe that home ownership provides pride. The population in North Omaha consists mainly of rentals. Rentals that are sometimes not taken care of by the landlords. Children grow up in an unclean environment which is not theirs on top of that. With our program, we plan on helping 101 families move into freshly remodel homes that are affordable but that are also theirs.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> We believe our proposal contribute to community economic sustainability because the homes being purchased will allow each family to build a strong economic foundation given the fact that they will own an asset which will increase in value over time. It will also help the families improve their credits-if need be.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Best practices will be incorporated by providing a hassle free and easy way for 101 famiies to purchase their homes in an area which has a strong history of pride.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Improved education is definitely an outcome which we want to measure. We believe that homeownership is tied to children's excelling at school. Being in a clean and beautiful environment has a positive psychological benefit for children performance.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> We plan on taking surveys after the 101 families are all installed in their new homes and asking about the children's performance at school.</p>
