  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> 24/2 Child Care Center is transforming childcare in Omaha, Nebraska by providing a unique service: offering extended hours childcare services to single parents or those with non-traditional schedules (i.e., health care workers).

We consider ourselves both honored and privileged to offer parents a solution to their childcare needs, all the while, living out our dream of working with the leaders of tomorrow, our children, every day. 

24/2 Child Care Center will further penetrate the market in the business of caring for and educating children in a friendly and happy environment. Kevin McNear Sr. and Deborah McNear also recognize the opportunities for offering a learning environment that emphasizes cooperation, new skills development, and a strong sense of responsibility. 24/2 Child Care Center will serve its areas of caring working to make its operations more productive while at the same time controlling expenses. 

The motto of 24/2 Child Care Center is “Because you need quality childcare in the evenings and on weekends too!” As our name and motto implies, we are not your “normal” childcare center. We service families from 5:30 AM to 12:00AM on weekdays and we are open on Saturdays. During the child’s stay with us, they are ensured exceptional care. 

Investing in childcare is good for families, good for children (our future) and good for economies.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal will address quality of life standards throughout Omaha. Specifically, this grant will provide parents with exceptional extended hours childcare service. This, in turn, will lead to greater economic mobility for single-family households and parents with the non-traditional work schedules, in addition, this childcare center has an exceptional curriculum program. Ultimately, parents must work to provide a good life for themselves and their children.  However, many caregivers struggle to balance work and life responsibilities. Those who choose or would like to further their education are put under additional amounts of stress, for those who work nightshifts or need someone to watch their child while taking a night course, 24/2 Child Care Center's service would be vital.  Our ability to safely watch children at night or on the weekend could help a parent secure a higher-paying job (and thus improve their quality of life) or give them peace of mind while working the night or day shift.</p>
