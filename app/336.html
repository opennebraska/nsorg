  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Omaha 100 Inc. intends to provide $100,000 for 100 businesses over the next 3 years, under its 100 program to grow 100 scalable businesses with underserved leaders of color. In addition to this funding, Omaha 100 Inc will also be providing skills training, industry education, and business coaching technical assistance to North Omaha community businesses. Through its partnerships, Omaha 100 Inc. will coordinate technical assistance to provide business advisory, accounting, financial advisory, and legal services. To reverse the widespread economic turmoil that deepened existing disparities and challenges disproportionately felt in low-income and minority communities in North Omaha due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Omaha 100 Inc. will focus on underserved Social Economic Disadvantaged Individuals (SEDI) and Very Small Business (VSB) owners impacted by the global pandemic. Omaha 100 case managers and instructors will follow up with businesses to provide guidance and assistance with skills training. This will allow Omaha 100 Inc. to function as an all-in-one resource that can provide funding and technical assistance to underserved business owners spurring economic growth in the process. The pandemic highlighted the multisector approach that works so well in Nebraska – businesses, government at all levels, and the private sector working together committed to a common goal of serving Nebraska businesses. We urge the state to maintain that commitment by partnering with Omaha 100. The Economic Recovery Act funding can be about more than just a continuing response to the COVID pandemic – it can be a forward-looking approach to charting a strong, thoughtful, and strategic path for long-term recovery and resiliency. As trusted partners, Omaha 100 will be an integral part of the recovery for North Omaha and our innovative approaches can help fuel resiliency. While the funding is short-term, there will be a long-term impact on the resiliency of the North Omaha community. For Omaha 100 specifically, the funding is short-term. It will allow us to fully engage with North Omaha businesses and ramp up our operations to support access by the sector. This would not be possible without financial support.  The following statements are deeply rooted in our core values and drive how we show up and what we believe in our daily work.

· Successful businesses are supported businesses. North Omaha businesses need support from one another to achieve their greatest goals.

· No business can achieve its mission on its own. It is only when we connect, convene, and

collaborate to strengthen relationships so that we achieve something greater than ourselves.

· Leaders make better decisions when they represent the communities they serve. Decisions

made with a community are more viable than decisions made for a community.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> "IF you can see it you can be it".  Way to  do that is through changing our approach to investing in entrepreneurs. Instead of over mentored and underfunded.  This is the opportunity to not only recruit top talent but also provide that talent with an opportunity that has not always been afforded to the minority community.
We cannot "job" our way out of the wealth gap, we have to rely on entrepreneurship and innovation to create sustainable industry in our community. This is a chance to place big bets on our best and brightest.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our community is currently oversaturated with nonprofits and this gives us the opportunity to change the status quo of what's expected of minority talent in east Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This will transform the East Omaha community by providing transformational economic change that other places around the world have proven previously that it is an investment worth taking.  The goal of 1024 is to create wealth in the East Omaha community and this program will do it similar to the way that Russell Construction did it for ATL. Omaha will become the center of gravity for minority businesses in the country.</p>
