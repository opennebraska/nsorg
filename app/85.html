  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The YMCA of Greater Omaha has four recent, major capital projects. They each demonstrate the capacity to carry out a project on the scale of the Butler-Gast YMCA project proposed in this application. They also show how the YMCA’s approach to capital development is meeting community needs:

Westview YMCA: This new YMCA branch was designed, built, and operated in collaboration with Omaha Public Schools and the new Westview High School on 156th and Ida streets. The YMCA portion of this project totaled $13.5 million and was funded by a combination of OPS bond revenue and fundraising among Omaha-area foundations. This full-service YMCA branch includes a fitness center, pool, and multi-purpose exercise rooms. The high school partnership creates opportunities for students and faculty to easily access the YMCA’s health and wellness programming, and it creates learning and work opportunities for high school students. The facility opened in July 2022.

Buena Vista YMCA Express: This new YMCA branch is also a collaboration with Omaha Public Schools, this time at the new Buena Vista High School at 60th and L streets in South Omaha. The YMCA Express features a high-tech fitness center and multi-purpose space, and it is integrated with a health center staffed by OneWorld Community Health Centers. This project opened in August 2022.

Lakin YMCA Family Park: Also completed in the summer of 2022, this new outdoor park at the Charles E. Lakin YMCA in Council Bluffs serves both YMCA members and residents of surrounding communities. The park addresses a lack of green space in the local neighborhoods, and it enhances YMCA programming by creating outdoor opportunities for youth development and fitness activities. This project demonstrates the YMCA’s experience in developing outdoor space, which is an important component of the Butler-Gast project.

Sarpy Community YMCA Renovation & Expansion: This $500,0000 project includes the renovation of existing fitness space, new high-tech fitness machines, and the expansion of the fitness center. This project is funded in part by the Shovel-Ready Capital Recovery and Investment Act (LB566), administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. It demonstrates the YMCA of Greater Omaha’s capacity for adhering to requirements similar to those of LB1024 funding.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The project will renovate and expand the Butler-Gast YMCA in North Omaha, located in Census Tract 59.02, a Qualified Census Tract.

The Butler-Gast YMCA serves as a hub of health, wellness, and youth development in North Omaha. This all-ages community fitness center includes a gymnasium, cardio and weights equipment, swimming pool, group exercise rooms, and the adjacent Teen Center (currently operated by YouTurn). The YMCA branch provides exercise classes, preventive health programming, special classes and social activities for active older adults, youth sports, and swimming lessons. 

The Butler-Gast YMCA is well-connected in the community. It neighbors Omaha North High School and Skinner Elementary School, making youth activities accessible to students. It partners with Abide Network, Northstar, and Seventy Five North to train teenage lifeguards and provide free swim lessons, addressing disparities in water safety among Black children. The branch also hosts free public events such as a Black History Luncheon, Omaha Days carnival, and Halloween Trunk-or-Treat.

Per the Visioning Workshop findings: “Public health in North Omaha is poor, with many households and individuals struggling with obesity, cancer, and other diseases.” The Butler-Gast YMCA’s continuum of health and wellness programming helps North Omaha residents develop healthy lifestyles and prevent chronic disease.

The proposed project will renovate the 27-year-old, 29,000-square-foot main building, add a 15,000-square-foot second floor, and renovate the adjacent 5,000-square-foot Teen Center. It will add about 30 jobs, serve 3,500 North Omaha residents annually, and expand diverse, all-ages health programming:

-- Gymnasium rehabilitation, including wood floor, hoops, mats, paint, and lighting.

-- Exterior building refurbishment and parking lot repairs.

-- Aquatics center upgrades, including mechanical room updates.

-- Expanded wellness space, including additional high-tech equipment.

-- Reconfigured locker rooms to increase accessibility for all genders and all families.

-- Creation of the YMCA E-Sports Innovation Hub, providing engaging after-school activities for youth.

-- New urban soccer fields, making soccer possible within limited space.

-- New outdoor pickleball and basketball courts.

-- New intergenerational multi-purpose rooms to serve children, parents, and seniors.

-- New community kitchen.

-- Upgraded steam room and sauna, replacing outdated plumbing.

-- Upgraded electrical systems.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Concept development is now underway, schematic design will begin in August 2023, and construction will be completed in June 2025. Please see the attached timeline.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> Public health outcomes: Address poor public health outcomes in North Omaha by making high-quality wellness and preventive health services accessible to local residents.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Sustainable Community: The project will enhance the Butler-Gast YMCA’s ability to deliver health and wellness services to a community with longstanding public-health challenges, including elevated rates of obesity, cancer, and other chronic diseases. It will provide new recreational opportunities, including urban soccer, innovative e-sports programs, and high-tech fitness equipment and classes. Through a sliding-fee scale, the Butler-Gast Y makes these high-quality services affordable for low-income families in North Omaha. In fact, last year 44% of members qualified for reduced price memberships and program fees.

Quality of Life: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that Black children ages 5 to 19 drown in swimming pools at a rate 5.5 times higher than that of white children. Among children 11 to 12 years old, the rate is 10 times higher. The Butler-Gast YMCA provides accessible swim lessons for all ages and ability levels to help reduce this disparity in North Omaha. Swim lessons are available at the Y on a sliding fee scale for low-income families, and free swim lessons are provided through partnerships with Northstar and Seventy Five North.

Public health outcomes: As detailed in the Visioning Workshop findings, North Omaha experiences poor public health outcomes. For example, the prevalence of inactivity among adults in North Omaha is 36% higher than the rest of the city, 71% of North Omaha residents are overweight or obese, and 40% are obese. North Omaha residents also experience high rates of diabetes (24%) and pre-diabetes (20%) (Appendix B: North Omaha Inventory and Opportunities Memorandum, page B18). The Butler-Gast YMCA delivers youth sports and exercise programs for all ages, helping residents cultivate healthy lifestyles and prevent the onset of chronic disease.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The project takes advantage of strengths and opportunities in North Omaha, and helps to mitigate weaknesses and threats, including those highlighted in the Visioning Workshop:

Strengths: The Butler-Gast YMCA is conveniently located on the Ames Avenue corridor, taking advantage of existing public transportation and proximity to nearby neighborhoods. It is safely accessible by walking and biking and adjacent to Omaha North High School and Skinner Elementary School. This location makes it safe and convenient for students and busy families to make the YMCA’s health and wellness opportunities and youth programs part of their daily routines.

Opportunities: North Omaha has a relatively young demographic with a lively immigrant community. The Butler-Gast YMCA delivers youth sports, e-sports, and swimming lessons for children and families with young children in North Omaha. The Y is involved in community events, such as Omaha Days, to reach diverse community members. 

Weaknesses: Local investment in North Omaha is not sufficient. The YMCA of Greater Omaha, its annual campaign donors, and partnering foundations make significant annual investments in the Butler-Gast YMCA. About 44% of members at this branch get reduced price memberships and program fees due to family income. This is made possible by grants, charitable contributions, and the YMCA’s intentional efforts to allocate resources justly across the Omaha metro area. This project is a major addition to this existing, ongoing investment in the Butler-Gast YMCA, and it represents the YMCA of Greater Omaha’s commitment to strong health and wellness programming in North Omaha.

Another North Omaha weakness is that planning and capital processes do no take culture and people into account. To address this weakness, the Butler-Gast YMCA – like all Y branches – has a branch advisory board that meets with the branch’s executive director. The following volunteers help both the Butler-Gast YMCA and the Maple Street YMCA tailor programming to meet North Omaha’s needs:

Bob Edick, Kiewit Construction
Dr. Melissa Stephens, The Cordial Cherry
Jason Thompson, Region 6
Jeff Schmaderer, Lozier Corporation
Mike Sharp, First Data
Mike Stice, Chick-Fil-A
Nichole Eggers, CHI Health Immanuel
Pamela Alston, Omaha Public Schools
Rachel Fox, You Go Girl
Tarina Cox-Jones, Skinner Magnet Center Elementary
Tumi Oluyole, Jan-Pro of Omaha & Ocean’s Drive Transportation

The YMCA also uses the Listen360 customer feedback platform and the Net Promoter Score framework to measure member enthusiasm and collect feedback about the facility and its programs. These scores and feedback are used to build on high-demand programs and address areas that need improvement.

Threats: As the Visioning Workshop noted, “Unemployment rates in North Omaha are relatively high and persistent poverty exists in the area, threatening quality of life among North Omaha residents.” The Butler-Gast YMCA addresses this threat by making youth development and health and wellness programming accessible for low-income families through a sliding fee scale. All community members deserve opportunities to strengthen their own health.

Lastly, the Visioning Workshop also noted the poor state of public health in North Omaha. Again, the Butler-Gast YMCA is mitigating this threat by providing a safe, affordable, and accessible place for people of all ages to establish and maintain healthy lifestyles.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project aligns with the priorities of LB1024:

Transformational: The Butler-Gast YMCA advances public health in North Omaha by creating accessible, affordable health, wellness, and youth development opportunities. It transforms lives by empowering people to take charge of their physical well-being.

Fundamental Change: Located in a highly visible place along the Ames Avenue corridor, the Butler-Gast YMCA project will revitalize the physical infrastructure of the area. Combined with Omaha North High School and Skinner Elementary School, the YMCA branch creates a hub of daily life around education, health, and wellness.

Long-Lasting Economic Growth: The expanded Butler-Gast YMCA branch will add a projected 25 to 35 jobs once it is completed. These jobs include entry-level professions like lifeguarding, which provide rewarding pay and help young people learn responsibility and important professional skills for their future careers. These jobs also include at least two full-time professional jobs with average salaries of $40,000.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> With the completion of this renovation and expansion project and the increase in utilization of the facility and additional programs, we anticipate adding two full-time positions with an average annual salary of $40,000. We also anticipate adding about 30 part-time positions with an average hourly wage of $14.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> $40,000 average salary for full-time jobs; $14 hourly for part-time jobs.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The YMCA of Greater Omaha is committed to broadly disseminating vendor opportunities and reaching small, minority-owned, and women-owned businesses in the bidding process. For the Butler-Gast YMCA project, we will use lists from the City of Omaha Planning Department and Human Rights & Relations Department to ensure that we’re reaching businesses and contractors in qualified Census tracts.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Butler-Gast YMCA project will increase livability in North Omaha by providing high-quality, accessible, and affordable health and wellness services to thousands of North Omaha residents every year. Last year’s Butler-Gast membership count was more than 2,000 community members. After the renovation and expansion project, we anticipate that more than 3,500 members will benefit every year. We base this projection on recent experience and analyses of other YMCA projects across the country conducted by Gro-Dev, our development partner. More than 40% of these members will come from low-income families and lack resources for accessing other health and wellness options. 

The project will improve the local neighborhood by enhancing the appearance, increasing the capacity, and extending the life of the Butler-Gast YMCA. With these renovations, the facility will continue to be a hub of health and wellness for community members of all ages for decades to come.

The project diversifies the local economy by providing 25 to 35 jobs at various levels and in multiple professionals. Especially important, entry-level professions like lifeguarding teach young people responsibility and prepare them for a wide range of careers.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The Buter-Gast YMCA contributes to economic sustainability by providing diverse jobs: everything from managers to fitness instructors to maintenance professionals to lifeguards. This diverse workforce helps provide a continuum for workers young and old and community members who seek full- or part-time employment. The YMCA purchases 90% of its goods and services locally, expanding economic impact by supporting other local businesses.

The project also contributes to economic sustainability by making YMCA programs and services affordable and accessible for all community members, regardless of income.

The project contributes to the sustainability of the built environment by extending the life of the building, ensuring that YMCA programs and services continue to thrive for decades to come.

Perhaps most importantly, the Butler-Gast YMCA addresses serious quality of life challenges in North Omaha, where public health is generally poor and chronic diseases – obesity, cancer, and others – are more prevalent. Wellness programs at the YMCA can prevent many of these illnesses, and by engaging children in exercise and healthy routines at an early age, we can help them develop healthy habits and achieve lifelong wellness.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> E-Sports: A key feature of the project is the transformation of the existing Teen Center building into the YMCA E-Sports Innovation Hub. E-Sports is a cutting-edge way for young people to learn some of the same values learned through physical youth sports. The field saw extraordinary growth during the pandemic and has become a fixture in after-school programs, high schools, colleges, and some YMCAs. Through the E-Sports Innovation Hub, young people in North Omaha – and especially students from neighboring Omaha North High School – will learn sportsmanship, leadership, communication, and teamwork in all weather and all seasons.  Urban Soccer Fields: Currently, the Butler-Gast YMCA offers an array of outdoor youth sports opportunities in partnership with the Maple Street YMCA, where there is ample space for youth sports fields. Through this project, the Butler-Gast YMCA will gain new Urban Soccer Fields. These small-scale fields are surrounded by walls, similar to a hockey rink, enabling real soccer competitions and skill-building in a fraction of the space required by full-size soccer fields. This new innovation is making soccer more accessible to inner-city youth.  High-tech exercise equipment: The Butler-Gast YMCA will gain innovative exercise equipment that connects with members’ phones and provides new ways for setting, tracking, and achieving health and wellness goals. This high-quality experience is normally exclusive to expensive fitness clubs, but the YMCA is making the technology more widely available to all community members.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The renovated and expanded Butler-Gast YMCA will serve a projected 3,500 members annually, an increase of 75% over 2021. A key outcome is enthusiasm among the community members we serve: The YMCA uses Net Promoter Score surveys to measure how many members will enthusiastically recommend the Y to friends and colleagues. The Butler-Gast YMCA’s current score is 54%, slightly below the YMCA of Greater Omaha’s citywide average. Through this project, we aim to increase the Butler-Gast score and exceed the citywide average of 59%, showing that we are meeting the community’s and members’ needs.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The Net Promoter Score is measured through standardized surveys, made available at in-person kiosks and via e-mail. The YMCA partners with Listen360 Customer Engagement Software to independently collect, analyze, and report results by location and program.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> While this request would fully fund the proposed renovation and expansion project, it will draw additional investment in three ways:  -- The YMCA of Greater Omaha, its annual campaign donors, and local foundations will continue to contribute to supporting programming at the Butler-Gast YMCA. Because 44% of Butler-Gast members rely on reduced price members and fees, the Y and its donors bring additional investment to the community to guarantee equitable health and wellness opportunities. As shown in the attached proforma, the YMCA anticipates providing $450,000 in financial assistance over three years at the Butler-Gast Y.  -- YMCA capital projects are known to draw economic development in the immediate vicinity. For example, the Westview YMCA and Westview High School in northwest Omaha have become a catalyst for retail development on the east side of 156th Street and new apartment complexes at 156th and Ida streets.  -- If this project is not fully funded by this grant, the YMCA of Greater Omaha would seek to raise funding from some of its longtime supporters, including local foundations that have supported Butler-Gast programming in recent years. The YMCA has capital campaign fundraising experience and capabilities from the Westview YMCA construction project and other recent projects.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> To help plan this project and to assess and plan for other capital needs, we have a contract with Gro-Dev. Formed in 2014, Gro-Dev provides professional services in real estate and facility development, architecture and design, facility management consulting, procurement, capital planning, and capital formation. The firm specializes in serving YMCAs across the country. Its goals are to make YMCA branch locations magnetic, sustainable, sound, highly performing, well-located, operationally efficient, and inclusive centers for youth development, health and well-being, and community engagement. Gro is contracting with the YMCA of Greater Omaha to conduct market analyses to inform capital plans and to project revenue and costs.  For ensuring the ongoing maintenance and operation of the renovated Butler-Gast YMCA, we will partner with Trimpe Real Estate Group, LLC, which contracts with the YMCA on the maintenance of current branch locations.  With the transformation of the current Butler-Gast Teen Center into the E-Sports Innovation Hub, we envision exciting potential partnerships with Omaha North High School and other youth-serving organizations in North Omaha. The project will also allow the Butler-Gast YMCA to build on recent and existing partnerships:  -- Abide Network: Lifeguard training for teens. -- Seventy Five North: Free community-based swim lessons. -- Northstar: Free swim lessons at the Y. -- Nobility Point: Exercise classes for active older adults.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> We have an existing contract with Trimpe Real Estate Group, LLC, for the maintenance of YMCA branch locations. We also have a contract with Gro-Dev for assessing and planning capital needs.</p>

  <h3>DesignEstimatingBiddingCostsDetermined</h3>
  <p> Costs were budgeted based on renovation and new construction costs from recent projects on a per square foot basis. These costs were further informed by analyses of YMCA projects across the country conducted by Gro-Dev. Recent projects here in the Omaha area include the Westview YMCA completed in July of this year, the Buena Vista YMCA completed in August of this year, the Lakin Family Park completed this summer, and the renovation of the Sarpy Community YMCA, which is ongoing.</p>

  <h3>GeneralContractorPublicCompetitiveBid</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>GeneralContractorPublicCompetitiveBidWhyNot</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The requested amount is equal to the total project budget, which is based on recent construction and renovation costs, measured on a square-foot basis, experienced by the YMCA of Greater Omaha at other projects, including the Westview YMCA, the Buena Vista YMCA Express, and the Sarpy Community YMCA. In the attached Butler-Gast YMCA capital development presentation, we include additional cost analyses and recommendations from Gro-Dev.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> As shown in the attached budget, LB1024 grant funds will be used to cover all project costs from design to construction.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The project will result in a Butler-Gast YMCA that is larger than the current footprint and serves more people, thus increasing operating costs (as detailed in the attached operating proforma). However, exterior, electrical, HVAC, and other mechanical upgrades will increase cost-efficiency and partially offset the increased costs of a larger facility. YMCA projections show that the post-project operating budget will be sustainable based on revenue from a growing membership base and continued investment by YMCA donors and local foundations.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> The YMCA of Greater Omaha has not yet secured additional funding for this project. If this grant request is partially awarded, we will likely seek gap funding from longtime supporters of the Butler-Gast YMCA and supporters of other YMCA capital projects.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> We would approach additional funding sources, if necessary, rapidly after the announcement of this grant award. We anticipate a three- to six-month decision-making process, with additional funds being secured late in 2023.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> LB1024 funds would activate this project. Without LB1024 funding, this project would be delayed until another significant source of funds can be identified, or it would be completed more slowly in a piecemeal fashion.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> Renovations to the existing structure would be prioritized over the construction of additional space and amenities. If a smaller grant amount is awarded, the project leadership team would meet to prioritize features, consulting with the Butler-Gast Advisory Board and community members in order to meet the highest priority needs.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> At this time, the YMCA of Greater Omaha has not designated reserve funds for this project. If this grant application is partially funded, YMCA leadership and the board of directors may consider contributing reserve funds while also seeking support from local foundations. As shown in the attached operating proforma, the YMCA of Greater Omaha is committed to investing unrestricted funds in the ongoing operation of the renovated and expanded facility.</p>
