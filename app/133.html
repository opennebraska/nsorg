  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Emergency Student Fund is one of four proposals being submitted by Creighton University. The four innovative and thoughtful projects collectively have the potential to be transformative, lead generational change, and have long-lasting economic growth. 

Each year across the country more students who begin a bachelor’s degree at a 4-year institution fail to complete the degree in 6 years.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 64% of students who began seeking a bachelor’s degree at a 4-year institution in fall 2014 completed that degree at the same institution within 6 years.  For more selective, private institutions, like Creighton, that rate increases to 68%.  That is still problematic for students who have taken out loans and leave higher education without a degree.  This problem is exasperated for those who have chosen to enroll in a professional program and are unable to complete the advanced degree.  

To support students and minimize financial barriers, Creighton seeks $1.5M in an emergency fund to be spent over the next three academic years (AY23-AY25).  The micro grants will assist students in completing their education and becoming contributing members of our community economically and socially.  

The number of students impacted will be based on the applicant pool and the severity of each case.  These micro grants are non-renewable.  

Proposed criteria:
•	Returning student to Creighton who has maximized federal loan eligibility
•	Student must have met with a Creighton Enrollment Specialist to promote financial literacy 
•	Student is in good academic and conduct standing at Creighton
•	Funds can be applied to tuition and mandatory fee expenses only 

Preferences: 
•	Student has completed no less than 1/3 of the academic program
•	Student is from the North and South Omaha Qualified Census Tract
•	Student is prohibited from progressing in the academic program due to financial hardship
•	Amount per term cannot exceed $10,000 for any individual student
Selection process:
•	Application must be completed and submitted to Creighton’s Director of 
Financial Aid
•	Selection will be made in collaboration with the Director of Financial Aid, Vice Provost of Enrollment, Vice Provost of Student Success, and Dean of respective College/School where the student is enrolled</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Applications for student emergency funds would be made available as early as the 2023-24 academic year and the funds would be exhausted no later than June of 2026.  Applications would be accepted throughout the year and reviewed monthly.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Emergency Student Fund will provide access to emergency funding for students who encounter unanticipated expenses while attending Creighton University.  Students will have an opportunity to apply for these emergency funds enabling them to continue to pursue a degree.  Annually Creighton has hundreds of students appeal for additional financial aid, but with limited resources and limited access to federal and state funding, the need exceeds the available allocations.  Micro grants made available to students exhibiting financial hardship will allow students to continue and complete their education.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> It is well documented that college graduates outperform their peers who have only completed a high school degree. Thus, the opportunity to provide emergency funding to enable students to continue to matriculate towards degree completion is so critical.  For example, the average graduate is 24% more likely to be employed and average earnings among graduates are $32,000 higher annually (Ref. 1).  Additional benefits extend beyond earnings potential and include many factors that contribute to society. Those with college degrees are more than twice as likely to volunteer and they contribute nearly 3.5 times more money to charity (Ref. 2). Furthermore, 75% of individuals with bachelor's degrees vote in presidential election years, compared with about 52%of high school graduates (Ref. 3).
College graduates are considerably less reliant on government programs and services than those with a high school degree. These government programs include Medicaid, housing subsidies, nutrition assistance, unemployment benefits, and other public assistance. For instance, those who graduated college are 3.5 times less likely to be impoverished and nearly five times less likely to be imprisoned. In all, lifetime government expenditures are $82,000 lower for college graduates than for those with high school degrees.2

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> In LB1024, the Legislature has identified select priorities for the Omaha qualified census tracks. The emergency fund will assist students and help to avoid further economic and social turmoil in many families.  The societal impact of a more educated society will further the impact for those residing in the qualified census tracks.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> As mentioned above, communities benefit from an educated society.  The emergency fund will provide the necessary assistance to address a financial burden that may interrupt or halt matriculation toward degree completion.  An average bachelor’s degree recipient contributes $381,000 more in taxes than they use in government services and programs over their lifetime. Those with high school degrees contribute just $26,000 more. That is a contribution of $355,000 more per bachelor’s degree holder over those whose highest degree is a high school diploma. Those with advanced degrees contribute even more—another $167,000 on top of the $355,000 for those whose highest degree is a bachelor’s degree (Ref. 1)

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> We remain convinced that we can impact the number of college graduates coming from the North and South Omaha census tracks.  The proposed emergency fund would provide a bridge for those students who have been challenged by an interruption in their financial plan.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Tracking the graduate rates of students who obtain emergency funds will be a direct measure of impact.  Creighton University will complete this assessment.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The amount requested was determined based upon the requests for ARPA funding made by students during the recent pandemic.  Creighton believes the need will continue to exceed the available funds, but this amount will address immediate and most relevant requests.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Creighton is seeking $1.5M in an emergency fund to be spent over the next three academic years (AY23-AY25).  The intent is to allocate approximately $250K in 2023, $500K in 2024, $500K in 2025, and $250K in 2026 supporting students with financial barriers prohibiting them from continuous enrollment over three academic terms.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> These are one-time use funds and will be exhausted at the end of the grant – 2026.  The education obtained by students and their contributions to society are sustainable, albeit the funding source will have to be replaced via additional grants or fundraising efforts.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> The number of students impacted is directly related to the size of the grant funding.  If Creighton was to be provided with more funding, the University would be able to assist and support more students at a greater level.  With less funding, the fewer students impacted and the potential of additional students leaving higher education without a degree and debt.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The University will be committing organizational support in personnel to administer the student emergency funds.  The University will have systems to process and evaluate applications in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
