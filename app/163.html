  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim: Reinforcing Our Roots, Living Our Maya Heritage (CMPI) was formed in 2007 by the Q'anjob'al Maya community in Omaha, NE. CMPI is a 501(c)(3) organization of the Maya Community in Nebraska dedicated to empowering the Maya people through community development programs. Through an innovative and indigenous-led model, CMPI and the Q’anjob’al Maya leadership support the nearly 4,000 Q’anjob’al Maya living in Omaha, NE. CMPI’s Mission is to improve the health and well-being of Mayan people through community development strategies in Omaha, Nebraska and Q’anjob’al Maya territory consistent with the Q’anjob’al Maya system of social organization and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. With our regenerative agriculture, health, arts, education, human rights and economic development programs, CMPI envisions contributing to the social, cultural and economic vitality of the wider society we live in.

Maya Health Initiative: For ten years, CMPI’s has had an ongoing Maya Health Assessment Study in collaborative efforts with Creighton University's Department of Social and Cultural Studies, as well as monthly health promotion sessions and an annual Indigenous Peoples Health Fair in partnership with One World Community Health Centers. Creighton Medical Students share their knowledge on topics including diabetes, cholesterol, and healthy living and the Maya community share their knowledge on Maya Medicine, Maya worldview and spirituality with medical students. Recently, CMPI secured ARPA funding to support the Empowered Women, Healthy Families program to provide culturally competent support and programming for women impacted by domestic violence. 

Maya & Indigenous Peoples Human Rights Program: The Maya & Indigenous Human Rights Program (MIHRP) is a Maya and Indigenous led program focused on the rights of Maya and Indigenous Peoples in the U.S. and in our ancestral territories. We have Maya and Indigenous advocates in Omaha, NE, the Cherokee Nation Reservation, Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA and Arizona at the U.S. - Mexico Border Region. There are three main programs and areas of focus: 1) Maya & Indigenous led immigration legal services; 2) Maya led civic engagement in Omaha, the State of Nebraska, and nationally; & 3) Maya led human rights law projects in Maya Territories.​ 

CMPIs Maya Arts and Culture programs highlight the presence of the Maya in Omaha through the arts. The program consists of Maya Calendar based cultural celebrations, visual and performing arts, including our mural and EPIC Play that incorporate Maya culture, history and worldview. Our cultural celebrations include Maya music, dance performance and visual arts based on the Maya sacred book, the Popol Vuh, as well as Maya cuisine. In 2019, CMPI, with the help of A Midsummer Mural company, designed and painted a mural representing the Mayan peoples of Omaha as part of the South Omaha Mural Project.

Maya Regeneration Project: The Q’anjob’al Maya people possess profound wisdom and agricultural knowledge and have forged meaningful connections with other indigenous groups in Nebraska. But we are also a displaced indigenous people, and many of us live in economic poverty. We propose combining this indigenous wisdom and knowledge with recent advancements in regenerative agriculture to create a food production system that will provide healthy, local food, lift Maya people out of poverty in Nebraska and contribute to broad economic development. In the meantime, we have built a community garden at our Maya Community Center in South Omaha, worked with Sacred Seed at a pop-up garden downtown, and farmed a quarter of an acre in Lyons, NE in partnership with farmer Graham Christensen, The Nature Conservancy, and Green Cover. The Nature Conservancy and The Agrarian Land Trust have been key to exploring a land title-holding model for the Maya Regeneration Farm to create a Maya Agrarian Commons with an IRS 501c25 legal structure.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs project at Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim and its Maya Economic Development Corporation will provide Q'anjob'al Maya immigrants with the language access, training, tools, and resources they need to start or grow their small businesses through cooperative models and other business structures, such as LLCs. As a displaced indigenous people that left their traditional homeland in Guatemala due to targeted violence and poverty, approximately 3,000 Q'anjob'al Maya now call Omaha home. Some Q'anjob'al Maya entrepreneurs have opened businesses in Omaha including convenience stores and painting, cleaning, and construction businesses. However, there are many community members, especially women, former business owners in Guatemala, and Q'anjob'al-only language speakers, that want to open a business in Omaha but require additional support to successfully launch their ventures. This project will fill this service gap in South Omaha from June 2023 (or when funds are received) to July 2025 with Omaha Economic Recovery Funds and will continue on after the project timeframe as permanent programming at Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs project of Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim and its Maya Economic Development Corporation supports the Sustainable Community need and goal of the Omaha Economic Recovery Act Coordination Plan. Led by Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim, which is headquartered in South Omaha, and in collaboration with the Nebraska Cooperative Development Center at UNL and the Nebraska Extension Latino Small Business Development Program, and other collaborating partners, we will provide Maya immigrants with the language access, training, tools, and resources they need to start or grow their own small businesses through cooperative models and other small business structures, such as LLCs. 

Utilizing the Native Nations Rebuilding framework developed by the The Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, the Q’anjob’al Maya community has launched a strategic plan to provide for its community and promote greater prosperity and sustainability. This strategic plan included the formation of the Maya Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) which is incorporated in Nebraska and is pending its 501c3 status. MEDC’s mission as a Q'anjob'al Maya owned enterprise, is to foster entrepreneurship among all Maya citizens, create socially responsible investment opportunities, provide access to competitive capital for Maya-owned businesses, and drive trade with other Indigenous communities and the world. The Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs program will include activities including: 

Support entrepreneurs with foundational tools including ESL classes for Q'anjob'al and Q'anjob'al/Spanish speakers
Provide technology literacy and basic to advanced computer skills classes implemented by community partners and translated by CMPI or implemented directly by CMPI
Give financial literacy classes to emerging entrepreneurs and community members
Educate community members on small business models and pathways including cooperatives and LLCs
Support small business development through access to speciality business and cooperative consultants and free legal services for filing and incorporation
Provide access to an Enterprise Hub with computer, internet, and printer access
Sponsor select program participants to attend small business and cooperative conferences
Launch or grow small businesses through a Fondo Semilla to support at least 10 businesses
Formally launch the Maya Chamber of Commerce to create a network and community of Maya entrepreneurs
Facilitate access to banking and capital by developing a working relationship with an Omaha-based credit and savings union and a CDFI
Launch community trainings with the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development and the Native Nations Institute at the University of Arizona to deepen understanding and adoption of the Native Nations Rebuilding framework

This project will ensure the success of small business development by following a planning process with program participants that will include:
Gathering Information & Visioning: Creating a vision, identifying steering teams,
community organizing and prefeasibility.
Needs Assessments: Conduct community surveys to better understand the interest and
need for their cooperative/LLC idea. This may include community members that may use the service (i.e., grocery store), and potential customers of the business.
Feasibility & Market Study: Feasibility is primarily connected to initial community
surveys and research markets. Assisting with building budget. 
Business Plans: All new and emerging cooperatives and LLCs are strongly encouraged to write a business plan and the program assists in writing these plans and evaluating them.

Cooperatives are especially adept models for low-income entrepreneurs to provide in-demand services for the community such as childcare, healthy food access, home care for disabled and elderly, affordable housing, and accessible investment opportunities.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Many needs emerged from the South Omaha visioning workshop that could be addressed through cooperative models and small business support including: need for improved access to healthy food (especially fruits and vegetables) through accessible and affordable grocery stores; quality and affordable daycare; safe and affordable housing; improved infrastructure for more business opportunities; job training and ESL classes; entrepreneur support; financial literacy education; access to capital; and multilingual support.

The Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs project would address these challenges through curated programming for Q'anjob'al and Q'anjob'al/Spanish speakers including access to ESL classes, financial and technology literacy classes, access to capital through seed grants and cooperative formation, supporting cooperative and LLCs formation, and access to trilingual business banking and financing services through credit union and CDFI partnerships. In collaboration with our Maya Regeneration Project, the Maya Economic Development Corporation will also provide locally grown fruits and vegetables to local grocers at discounted rates, and depending on program participant interest, may develop a food cooperative to ensure access to healthy, locally grown food in South Omaha food deserts.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs project aligns with LB 1024’s strategic priorities by supporting: 

Transformation: Connecting Indigenous entrepreneurs to culturally relevant and Q'anjob'al/Spanish accessible services, tools, capital, and community to support their journey towards starting or expanding a small business.

Fundamental Change: Indigenous peoples are often overlooked within the Latino community and the specificity of their needs, identity, and history are not addressed with traditional services. Through tailored support to the Q'anjob'al Maya community, they can be a part of improving the lives of South Omaha residents through economic and physical development.

Long-lasting Economic Growth: Through small business and cooperative support for the Q'anjob'al Maya, community members will create new jobs, invest financially in South Omaha through their small business investments and revenue generated by their customers, and create generational wealth by improving the economic standing of their families, creating legacy businesses, and exposing their children to new opportunities through entrepreneurship and community building.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We anticipate at least 30 new jobs and at least $1.5 million annually in new wages to be directly created through this proposal.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 30</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 5</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Staff hired to run the program’s salaries are between $70,000-$85,000. According to Zippia, which pulls data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Foreign Labor Certification Data Center, the average business owner salary in Nebraska is $71,140. Taking into account that new business owners will likely make less in the first years of their enterprise, we are estimating that new small business owners would be able to make $50,000 per year.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Since these jobs will be created by Q'anjob'al Maya small business owners and cooperatives in South Omaha, they will be created in qualified census tracts. Additionally, with most community members’ networks residing in South Omaha, we anticipate that people hired by small businesses and cooperatives and services purchased by these businesses will also be within South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The South Omaha and broader Omaha community will benefit from this project through increases employment, small business ownership, increases in tax revenue, greater equity for Indigenous populations related to access to financial and business development services, increased availability of services and goods for the community, increased autonomy and self-determination for indigenous peoples, reduced reliance on public benefits due to increased incomes, increased child welfare, improvements to social determinants of health, greater awareness in the community on issues and challenges faced by Indigenous peoples and how to best provide them with services and support.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This project will provide tailored support to a population that is often underserved due to language barriers, discrimination, and marginalization in Omaha and South Omaha. By providing a suite of classes and services in Q'anjob'al Maya and Spanish that are culturally-relevant and given by fellow community members, the Q'anjob'al Maya community will be more successful in their journey to become entrepreneurs. Additionally, if Q'anjob'al Maya community members decide to pursue cooperatives or LLCs that target lack of services including affordable homecare, childcare, housing, and access to healthy food, the economy and the quality of life for the Q'anjob'al Maya community, the South Omaha community, and the broader community, will be improved. While the program activities and outreach will be directed towards Q'anjob'al Maya community members, any and all Omaha community members are welcome to attend and participate in classes and trainings.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> This program will bring new services to Omaha, including Q'anjob'al Maya-specific program materials and services as well as a hub for education on cooperative models and small business development for Spanish speakers. While cooperatives are more common in Nebraska within an agricultural and food context, there are not any active cooperatives in Omaha tackling issues such as grocery stores in food deserts, housing, childcare, homecare, and investment opportunities for lower income populations.   Additionally, the adoption of the Native Nations Rebuilding framework by a diaspora population, such as the Q'anjob'al Maya, to rebuild and provide for itself as a displaced indigenous population is an innovative approach to community development and advocacy. The transnational and intertribal network the Q'anjob'al Maya are creating here in Nebraska is an innovative approach to community building and organizing. Since 2015, the Q'anjob'al Maya have had a diplomatic relationship with the Omaha Nation which was recently expanded to include economic, social, and cultural development. The Q'anjob'al Maya have also brought Midwest native nations together including the Winnebago, the Ioway Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, and Oglala Sioux through the Indigenous Peoples Summit which took place on August 9, 2022, in Omaha, NE, a first of its kind gathering with Indigenous peoples from across the Americas.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> This project will measure skills attainment (ESL, financial literacy, technology literacy), number of members that join the Maya Chamber of Commerce, partnership development and collaboration, quality of life improvements, capital leveraged for small businesses and cooperatives, small businesses launched, and jobs created through this project.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Through the staff hired for this project, we will develop a monitoring and evaluation framework to track the success of this project. There will be pre and post tests where appropriate, quarterly tracking of program participant progress, number of businesses started, revenue generated, employees hired, and outside capital and investments secured.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> We do anticipate that the Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs project will spark co-investments and secondary investments such as through collaborations with Community Development Institutions such as Spark CDI, savings and credit unions such as Heartland Credit Union, and other partners we are cultivating. We will also be pursuing donated revenue opportunities to continue and expand this project.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> As mentioned above, Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim has developed or is developing several relationships to support the launch, development, and expansion of the Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs project and participants. We will collaborate with Nebraska Cooperative Development Center, Nebraska Extension Latino Small Business Development Program, and a savings and credit union, which may be Heartland Credit Union as we have had initial conversations with them to expand tailored services to South Omaha and the Q'anjob'al Maya community. Additionally, we’ve had initial conversations with Spark CDI about their developer academy for aspiring real estate developers and the access to capital they can provide small businesses and real estate projects. Where appropriate we will also collaborate with existing CMPI partner, the Latino Center of the Midlands, and seek to build a relationship with Do Space and further develop our relationship with Metro Community College - South Omaha campus to support our technology literacy programming. Finally, we have an existing relationship with Dr. Stephen Cornell from the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development and the Native Nations Institute at the University of Arizona. He attended our 2022 Indigenous Peoples Summit.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> We do not have signed MOUs agreements due to time constraints, but Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim has strong commitments from Charlotte Narjes, Associate Extension Education and Associate Director of UNL’s Nebraska Cooperative Development Center and Sandra Barrera Fuentes, UNL Faculty and Associate Extension Educator to support this project. Ms. Narjes and Fuentes both provided inputs for this application and budget. Additionally, Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim staff were able to attend the CooperationWorks! national conference that was hosted by UNL in Omaha, NE September 2022 thanks to an invitation from the Nebraska Cooperative Development Center.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> LB1024’s grant funds will be used to implement the Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs program and launch Maya Economic Development Corporation programming and operations. With this funding, CMPI will be able to apply for and leverage other funding and partnerships to support and grow the Supporting Indigenous Entrepreneurs program to build it into a long-term and sustainable project.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> As described above, this project will be managed by the Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim, a 501c3 organization. Once this initial funding is secured, it will allow CMPI and the Maya Economic Development Corporation to pursue other funding opportunities, investments, and partnerships to make it a long-term and sustainable project.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> We have $100,000 in operating support pledged from the Sherwood Foundation that we will direct towards this project. We will continue to seek additional funding to complement funds received through LB1024.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Receiving funds from the Omaha Economic Recovery Act would jump start the Maya Economic Development Corporation’s launch. This is a once in a lifetime chance to invest in the generational wealth of the Q'anjob'al Maya community in Omaha, a displaced indigenous people that fled targeted violence and poverty for a better life. As this project is part of CMPI’s strategic plan, CMPI will continue to actively pursue funding for this project.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> This proposal is scalable and could be completed in smaller components. Depending on the level of funding secured, CMPI and the Maya Economic Development Corporation can select which trainings and services to implement first and can scale up training and services as program participation and funding grows. Partnership development is key to scalability and segmenting the program, such as collaborating with a local savings and credit union, partnering with a community development institution like Spark CDI, and our collaboration with Nebraska Cooperative Development Center and Nebraska Extension Latino Small Business Development Program.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The organization will support this proposal financially by providing indirect cost support which will include additional staff support, such as from the CMPI Program Coordinator and the Director of Strategic Partnerships, as well as covering operations costs including office space, utilities, phone and internet access. The budget covers only 5% indirect cost, lower than the usual indirect cost rate.</p>
