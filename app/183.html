  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Our organizations have completed the following projects in Iowa and Nebraska. 
Albia Buiness Plaza, LLC - a shopping center that was tragically hit by a tornado.  Our team rebuilt the entire shopping center to become a thriving part of the Albia, Iowa community.  Perry Business Plaza, LLC - this center was abandoned.  We remodeled and demolished a portion of the property to become a center that is now a top attraction in the town of Perry, Iowa, boasting an Orschlen's and several supporting shops.  Hotel Arthur - our team remodeled the entire hotel down to the cement block and rebuilt the town's only hotel.  It went from two guests per day to 26 full rooms regularly.  City of Pacific Junction - Our team was chosen out of several bids to clean up the town's devastation after the 2019 flood.  The flooding completely buried the town and the clean-up was substantial.  
We have taken on the task of demolishing a several story abandoned packing plant at 2405 Z Street in Omaha.  These are just a few examples of the major projects we have completed recently.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Creating generational wealth for an underserved section of South Omaha requires resources that historically have not been available.  This exciting opportunity fits the concepts of Chamba Plaza  - a project predicated on rehabilitating existing real estate that has historically provided South Omaha with jobs and pride and turning the property back into a productive site. Chamba Plaza is a 30 tenant business hub with a centralized conference center, loading docks, and a plethora of parking.  We anticipate 100+ jobs through the flex workspace created through the small and startup contractors using the space and directly through the business support staff located onsite.

Z End operating as Chamba Plaza, purchased 1200 S. 17th Street in South Omaha and commenced work immediately.  The clean-up and expansion is ongoing and it sits ready for this project immediately.    
 
1200 S. 17th Street was an abandoned warehouse that previously employed numerous people in South Omaha.  Our vision is to expand that area to include a business complex that will provide commercial/industrial bays for those that need space.  The complex will also include a common area that houses a kitchen, conference room for the business owners to meet with customers, insurance providers, tax professionals, attorney, and others.  This business hub concept will provide immediate access to small businesses  that historically underutilized these services. 

This proposal provides bays with an office, restrooms and independent utilities. The building will be constructed with non-load bearing removable walls to provide business expansion.  Each bay will be constructed with 8-inch concrete walls providing security and sustainability.   

Chamba Plaza  intends to collaborate with South Omaha organizations to offer bi-lingual professional programs.  The conference areas will provide an essential meeting space conducive to expansion and partnerships that will be fostered in this location.  

Currently, the opportunity to lease a business space in South Omaha is 1.9% (See attached Industrial South Omaha Submarket Report).  The need is clear - and we are in the perfect position to fill the need with a parcel that sits ready to build the future for the citizens of South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> This location is immediately available to build.  We would like to commence work immediately.  Our anticipated timeline would have this site completed in 2024.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Transformational - This project intends to take an abandoned structure that has been in need of repair and turn it into a hub of activity for several small businesses.  These small businesses have the opportunity to either work directly from the site or utilize this area as a drop-off.  For instance, if a self-employed roofer needs a spot to house his tools, currently his only option is to put them either in a garage (if available) or in his house at night.  The crew would need to meet at the house or the site and any extra materials would not be stored due to space available.  Chamba Plaza would provide a shop for the roofer.  In addition to meeting the needs of a central location for the roofing business, there would be access to an insurance company and an attorney for any needs the independent businessperson would require.  Chamba Plaza’s green space and conference rooms would provide additional areas for the companies to utilize that would provide added benefit to their small business.  
Fundamental Change:  The location of this project is adjacent to the newly renovated and revitalized Little Bohemia area that has exploded with interest.  This area would expand on this and allow both westerly and northerly expansion for the residents.  It would clean up an otherwise forgotten part of the city and allow an industrial connection for the workers and patrons of the area.  
Long-lasting Economic Growth:  This facet of Chamba Plaza garners the most for the area.  The explosion of industry and the ability to foster small business growth will allow a generational expansion of growth and education.  The proverbial passing of the torch to the next generation will be possible through the business hub that is created and fostered in the community in which the owners and patrons reside.  This continuing effort to achieve financial independence will allow prosperity to thrive.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This particular project aligns with the perceived SWOT strengths and focuses on both the weaknesses and the threats to the community.  First, the strengths identified include a population that is hard-working and rich in culture consisting of more than 60 percent Latinx. The weakness for these hardworking people includes that lack of infrastructure with dated commercial properties that are inaccessible.  The threats perceived include no land for growth and very old construction.  

Chamba Plaza  intends to provide this hard-working population with a new structure that will benefit the entire population giving them pride in their facilities as well as a gathering place.  These areas will additionally allow the patrons the workers the added benefit of addressing the transportation disparity by the location central to their homes instead of having to travel just to get to their employment. Several of the SWOT responses worried about transportation to work-sites.  These sites would be easily accessible to the community members.  The bus line stop is less than a block from the location.  The location is within the community.

The opportunities will provide a reuse of land that has languished for years and provide meeting and community spaces for the workforce that has a strong and proud history in the area.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024 specifically states that the priorities are to assist with small businesses and as well assist with business development.  Chamba Plaza  provides a plethora of opportunities for the citizens of South Omaha - including but not limited to the location of the business, access to assistance for forming businesses within Chamba Plaza, business insurance to continue the businesses and as well as providing a community experience for the businesses that are vital to the area.  This location will utilize the area’s organizations to assist in business development and maintenance.  

The ARPA guidelines fall squarely with Chamba Plaza’s ultimate goals.  The property is located squarely in the identified tract and the property is immediately ready for transformation.  The location will provide an immediate impact with the hiring of local contractors for the construction of the site as well as provide a location for the long-term housing of the small businesses that are created and the businesses that currently exist without a space to grow.  The anticipated employment impact will create more than 100 temporary and permanent jobs.  

Our intent is to place two structures on the parcel.  The project could feasibly be divided into the two separate buildings allowing for Phase I and Phase II of this project.  The ultimate goal is to have all of the contractors complete the building simultaneously to keep the project close to the budgeted amount.  Additional phases would add to the cost substantially.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Chamba Plaza  anticipates that the construction phase would garner dozens of jobs with the end result providing spaces for the community to expand in various employment opportunities.  
Commencing immediately upon receipt of funds, Chamba Plaza would employ individuals to facilitate the construction of the property.  This includes both the demolition of the current buildings, landscaping and construction of the new facility.  The project would employ numerous individuals and companies and we are committed to utilize as many residents of South Omaha as possible in the endeavor.  The wages will be commensurate with experience.  The hope is that these temporary jobs will lead to the employees investing in their own business and leasing a bay they just constructed.  
Additionally, the site will employ individuals to maintain the conference areas and the site itself.  These employees will be hourly.   The 30 plus bays will provide employment opportunities for over 100 workers. 
These employment opportunities will lead to additional traffic to the location as opposed to having the residents travel to other parts of Omaha for their work day - thereby increasing spending in local establishments.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> We anticipate that fully functional, this space will provide jobs for more than 100 people - with potential to provide jobs for many, many more.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Each facet of construction will provide at least 20 jobs.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> These will be skilled jobs such as mechanics and laborers as well as the professional degrees that will be on site.  These wages will range from approximately $52,000 to $150,000.00.  The small businesses will ultimately be able to determine their own salaries and the possibilities have no restrictions.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The aim is to commence work immediately upon receiving the grants.  This will provide construction work for dozens of workers immediately. Additionally, as discussed above, the increase in small business opportunities created by this project are indefinite.  The entire proposal is an attempt to attract and keep small business contractors in this specific Qualified Census Tract.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Chamba Plaza  provides the community with so many benefits immediately upon receipt of the grant monies.  The construction site is ready to be utilized for the purposes set forth herein - providing local jobs. The community has already benefitted with the clearing of the overgrown debris.  This proposal would provide an area of pride and a hub for businesses to showcase their work.  
The video and overview of the site illustrates what years of neglect had done to this site. 
Chamba Plaza aims to have a showcase property that will enhance the area and allow each of the tenants the ability to maintain their trades and provide a space for education alongside employment.  These bays will attract additional investment in the area from the increased traffic. The possibilities created by these bays will only grow.  The neighborhood will no longer have to look at the abandoned buildings in shame.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The area has an industrial setting that does not impede on the lives of the surrounding homes.  The proposal will not be removing any of the natural habitat but in fact will add a green space to provide an area of respite among the industrial tenants upon completion.  This area will be a community area that will allow a rest site for visitors and workers during their hectic schedules.  The sense of community in these green spaces will provide the ability for persons of alternate trades to meet and have discussions and respite.  Additionally, quality of life will improve by not having to travel to other parts of the city before and after work allowing a quicker transition home.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The concept we are proposing has been successful in various larger cities but there are none in the metro area.    Our concept brings small businesses together to provide a central location for growth.  Each bay will be provided with their own office, restrooms and utilities. The conference area will provide a location for tenants to meet with tax advisors, potential customers and business professionals.  The building will be built with non-load bearing walls in the interior.  The walls that separate the bays will be easy to remove and replace to allow the tenant’s growth.  With this concept, as their business expands, so can their space.  The exterior walls will be built with 8 inches of concrete.  These walls will provide sustainability and security. The lack of availability, affordability and adaptability is prevalent in these areas.  The spaces that become available to the small businesses that are in need are not conducive to the types of building space available.  For instance a mechanic cannot raise a car in their space due to the lowered ceilings.  Chamba Plaza  will include ceilings that are 22 feet.  Each bay will have access to loading docks for their goods.    Historically, some of the buildings have been ignored in South Omaha.  These  buildings have a use that does not fit the current needs of small business.  Examples of this are but not limited to a contractor that needs an elevated space to store building materials.  Storage of product with the elevated ceilings will provide endless possibilities for the space.  The 60’s and 70’s turned to metal buildings.  These buildings do not endure time with denting, fading and rusting.  The construction we are proposing will be adaptable to the times and will provide a structure that looks appealing and maintains the integrity of the design for years to come.  With the quality of construction we are proposing the small business will have “conveniences” of high ceilings and doors, energy efficiency, affordability to fill the hole that currently exists in South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Chamba Plaza will provide new job opportunities for the local community as well as a new aesthetic for the small business owner to allow for customers to visit them at their shop.  The measurement should be based on generational improvements in addition to the short-term increase in income.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The vacancy rates will determine if the small businesses have thrived.  If there are low turnover rates, we will be able to discern the success.  The request for additional space will illustrate business growth.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Absolutely!  This is precisely what Chamba Plaza hopes to promote.  Each business that is either initiated at South Works or comes to lease at South Works will have the ability to grow.  This type of investment in the community will allow the partnership of other entities to invest in the small businesses that will be a small seed that grows larger through each generation.  This development will be life-changing for generations to come.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> We intend to partner with local organizations that will bolster the business acumen of businesses located at South Works.  We intend to hold regular meetings with organizations that will provide essential business strategies such as incorporation and accounting advice.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> These funds will be utilized to demo the existing outdated structure and replace with the Chamba Plaza flex use concept that will allow expansion of each and every bay as the small business continues to grow and develop.

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> This investment will provide the ability to construct the buildings.  The rental income from the bays will provide the necessary income to maintain the project.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Chamba Plaza has not sought additional funding.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> Chamba Plaza has not sought additional funding.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Possibly but the extent of the build would be economically similar in nature as the costly portions of this would be incurred to prepare the site and not the actual number of flex spaces.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> As stated above, the budget reflects the fact that even if the project was decreased in the number of flex space bays, the cost associated with the preparation of the site would far exceed the actual structures.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Chamba Plaza through Z End, LLC has purchased the site.  Expenditures such as demolition, property clean-up, taxes and insurance is currently being paid.  The members will continue to keep their financial commitment to the area in tact regardless of the outcome of the application.</p>
