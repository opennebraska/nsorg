  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Proposal Overview | Partnership 4 Kids provides students in grades pre-kindergarten through 12th grade with door-to-door transportation to and from our offsite program experiences. Transportation is the defining factor in whether students, particularly those coming from underserved communities, are able to engage in opportunities such as college tours, leadership workshops, and hands-on career experiences that explore career fields ranging from cutting-edge technology to in-demand trades. National research indicates that the greatest barriers perpetuating the chronic achievement gap for students from low-income households is access to quality out-of-school learning, prohibitive both by the cost of participation and access to transportation. All P4K programming is provided at no charge to our students or their families. Providing free transportation not only ensures students’ access to quality experiences, but also ensures their safety.
Location | All P4K programming, support services, and interventions are primarily conducted within sixteen Title I schools from the Omaha Public Schools (OPS) District which are located in North and South Omaha (Fontenelle, Field Club, Gifford Park, Minne Lusa, Sherman, Franklin, McMillan, Monroe, Norris, Lewis & Clark, R.M. Marrs, Benson, Central, North, Northwest, and South). Of the sixteen schools in which P4K programming is offered, twelve lie within the Qualified Census Tract (QCT). It is important to note that of program-enrolled students that attend school outside of the QCT, self-reported data shows that 90.5% live within qualifying zip code and, as a result, are also being disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Omaha continues to experience high rates of generational poverty in the city’s Northeast and Southeast communities, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19.
P4K addresses the community need to serve a population of youth, grades pre-kindergarten through 12, who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Data shows that youth growing up in households with limited financial resources are among those who have been most profoundly affected by the pandemic. By serving this population of youth, P4K provides them with enhanced educational programming and postsecondary/career exposure, thus promoting their role in a sustainable community.
Partnership 4 Kids provides critical programming which includes life and job readiness skills, college tours, and career exploration experiences for participating students in our Book Buddy Program (pre-kindergarten through 4th grade), Goal Buddy Program (5th and 6th grade), and College and Career Readiness Program (grades 6-12) These opportunities expose P4K students to what is possible: postsecondary education, professional success, and financial stability. By providing door-to-door transportation, P4K removes a significant barrier to student participation in quality out-of-school learning experiences. After extensive research, we have determined that the most cost-effective, long-term solution to the issue of consistent transportation is to own two fifteen-passenger vans. Currently, P4K owns a single ten-passenger van, and the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the vehicle rental industry—prices have skyrocketed to upwards of $400/vehicle, and the rental availability is in a sharp decline. Additionally, P4K programming takes place after school which means local bus companies are occupied with the transportation of students. The budgeting and planning necessary to secure these rentals further limit the outings we can schedule and when. We spend a significant amount of staff time researching alternate transportation services (sub-contractors) and planning transportation routes and student outings strategically (combining student groups for outings, etc.). By providing the transportation services ourselves, we would maintain this critical service for our students. Additionally, we estimate that each van will be used roughly 190 days out of the year, making the financial benefits of van ownership significant, especially considering the aforementioned price per vehicle rental.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> P4K serves students attending school and living in North and South Omaha communities, within qualified census tracts and disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the North Omaha Inventory and Opportunities Memo, unemployment rates in North Omaha are relatively high and poverty rates are persistent. P4K addresses these threats to quality of life by promoting academic persistence and the exploration of postsecondary pathways to financially stable careers.
South Omaha has a thriving small business community which complements P4K’s career-focused programming supports and creates opportunities for students to engage in entrepreneurship and practice the skills necessary for entrepreneurial success. Vans would enable us to transport our students to these small businesses for entrepreneurial activities.
P4K also promotes students’ pursuit of 2-year degrees/certificate programs and maintains a strong partnership with Metropolitan Community College (MCC), UNO, and other area colleges for all our student program levels, thus increasing the likelihood of more students attending a local college. In addition to our well-established relationship with MCC, vans would enable us to transport students to the college’s various campuses for college visit/exploration opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in students’ social-emotional skills while steadily increasing the threat of mental health issues. P4K programs provide students with social-emotional learning/awareness, facilitate positive peer interactions, and create networks of support. The interventions provided by P4K, particularly those designed in response to COVID-19, are fostering hope in a community of students who really need it.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The purpose of P4K’s programming is to ensure Omaha youth, ages 5-17, who face racial or socioeconomic disparities, are equipped with the resources and motivation to academically persist, actively plan for, and progress toward a future that includes high school graduation, postsecondary education, professional satisfaction, and financial stability. P4K mentors and staff provide support and guidance that is focused on this purpose, engaging juvenile participants in targeted curriculum and opportunities to explore and prepare for higher education and viable career pathways. P4K’s efforts promote long-lasting economic growth in both North and South Omaha. By providing the supports and guidance necessary for our students to achieve academic success and financial stability. One of these critical supports is door-to-door transportation as transportation barriers impact not only attendance but academic persistence. With vans dedicated to student transportation, P4K can remove another barrier to student success and continue to promote their academic engagement.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Our program is specifically designed to level the playing field and ignite a passion for learning, goal setting, and advancement. Due to circumstances beyond their control, the population served by our programming has fewer resources and opportunities for advancement than those living in higher income communities. We work tirelessly to ensure these students have the same access to college campuses, networking opportunities, hands-on career experiences, etc. that are enjoyed by their more affluent peers. We provide the support necessary for these students to pursue postsecondary education and/or secure a career that will elevate them out of poverty. Many of our students enter our program believing that a postsecondary education is simply not an attainable goal due to their circumstances, but the annual increase of postsecondary enrollment rate over the past decade would suggest otherwise. With the proper supports and guidance, our students can achieve anything.
The work of Partnership 4 Kids not only impacts the students being directly served by our programming but their families as well. According to PBS Frontline, “children who grow up poor are more likely to be poor as adults. Furthermore, the likelihood increases with each year of poverty that is experienced.” Our programming is proven to help Omaha’s most underserved students achieve financial stability, breaking the cycle of generational poverty.
The passion for education that our students develop during their participation in our programming persists throughout their lives and even affects their children. P4K is proud to have served subsequent generations of students like Dr. Monique Cribbs and her son, Cayden. Dr. Cribbs not only completed our program, earning a bachelor’s degree, she recently earned her PhD in educational administration and joined our Board of Directors in 2022—her connection with our program has spanned more than 25 years. Even as an alumna of our program, Dr. Cribbs still had the support of P4K staff and leadership throughout her nine-year doctoral journey. Monique’s story is just one example of the incredible impact P4K’s programming can have on the academic persistence of Omaha’s youth.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Each year, hundreds of young people are positioned to overcome systemic barriers, household challenges, and trauma-induced behaviors by succeeding in their academics and exploring future careers. These students learn and practice skills that will increase their employability, their financial stability and, by extension, the economic stability of their communities. P4K prepares Omaha’s next generation to enter the job market with the confidence and skills to achieve career success. Furthermore, this preparation of Omaha’s next generation invigorates the workforce and stimulates the local economy.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Our programming is not patterned exclusively after one specific evidence/research-based practice, but rather utilizes multiple sources of evidence-based research on which its varied initiatives are based. Further evidence supports the need for student transportation as it is one of the most significant barriers to student participation in out-of-school programs and opportunities. According to John Bergen, Executive Director of the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Green Bay, few standalone grants for transportation exist, making it extremely difficult to secure funding for such a critical support (https://youthtoday.org/2018/05/transportation-a-barrier-to-participation-in-after-school-programs/). Research conducted by Pricilla Little and published in “The Massachusetts Special Commission on After School and Out of School Time” has identified six key barriers to student participation in after-school programs, including affordability, family factors, and transportation. Programs often struggle to provide safe transportation for students for several reasons: cost, distance, and lack of transportation. Another significant barrier associated with transportation is safety—oftentimes, parents are hesitant to have their children participate in after-school programming because they do not feel that their children can travel safely to and from their programs. Vans will enable us to combat these barriers to student participation, persistence, and success.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The most significant, measurable, outcome for this project is the reduction in rental and mileage expenses. Financial data can be collected, and comparisons can be made to previous years’ transportation expenses. Additionally, these vans will enable us to increase student access to career and postsecondary tours, interviews, internships, etc. that expand their exposure to viable employment opportunities. We will be able to usher our students out of their comfort zones, introducing them to opportunities beyond the classroom.P4K sees transformational change in participating students and, by extension, the community in which they live. They master new life skills that include positive decision-making, self-advocacy, conflict management, and healthy relationship development. These skills address the concerns that many underserved students must face, including academic challenges, truancy, and a lack of healthy interpersonal relationships. Program participants set concrete goals for college and career success, give back to their community, possess a confidence in their own abilities, and recognize the potential for their postsecondary success. P4K youth work toward their own goal achievement and success throughout the program, in preparation for college and their future careers. By preparing Omaha’s youth for postsecondary life and defining a clear pathway to success, P4K helps students to develop clear goals for their future, thus invigorating Omaha’s economy with an influx of skilled professionals. The return on investment will be great as the Omaha Metro welcomes P4K students to the workforce following their completion of a 2- or 4-year degree, an apprenticeship, or trade school. With focus on their individual success, they also form a community of supportive peers who root for one another and form lifelong bonds. An investment in the College and Career Readiness Program is an investment in the success of our community, elevating some of Omaha’s most vulnerable and underperforming youth through long-term support. This long-term support allows P4K to have a transformative impact on the community by changing not only the students we serve, but their families and future children as well—we can see generational change.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> P4K measurement and assessments begin by collecting, recording, and analyzing student, mentor, and program data, including grades, attendance, demographics, and case management notes. All participants are surveyed, and responses are analyzed to track youth progress and for program enhancement and improvement needs. We will be able to measure the impact of our vehicles through the gathering of program attendance data. The evaluation of P4K programming is conducted by our curriculum and evaluation department, consisting of a Director of Program Operations and Program Planning and Impact VISTA member. Partnership 4 Kids has partnered with the University of Nebraska Omaha STEPs (Support and Training for the Evaluation of Programs) Program to develop logic models and measures for all levels of programming. The evaluation team plans to continue this partnership in seeking ongoing training and guidance from the STEPs program. Evaluation results will be used internally to inform curriculum content, case management focus, and tutoring program content. Evaluation results are shared publicly through an annual report.</p>

  <p> The need being addressed is widespread and cannot be solved by siloed efforts. Therefore, P4K collaborates with many community partners for increased impact. P4K is constantly working to cultivate relationships with community nonprofits, corporations, postsecondary institutes, and volunteers. While P4K does not currently have any community partners for this specific funding request, we are open to exploring/evaluating the potential for collaborations with other local nonprofits or companies for the leasing of our vans based on the results of a risk vs. reward assessment.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Based on our research, we have estimated the purchase of two fifteen-passenger vans to be around $50,000.00/vehicle. Insurance will be about $4,500.00 for the first two years (2023-2024)--in 2025, it will be around $2,250.00. Licensing and tax will cost an initial $8,000.00 (2023), then $300.00 (2024) and $150.00 (2025). In 2023, the wrapping of two vans will be around $10,000.00 total--it will be a one-time expense. We estimate that parking and maintenance will cost $5,000.00 in 2023-2024 and $1,250.00 in 2025. The total of these expenses adds up to a sum of $133,750.00.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Transportation is critical for program success. National research supports that the greatest barriers perpetuating the chronic achievement gap for students from low-income households is access to quality, out-of-school learning; prohibited both by cost of participation and access to transportation. As such, P4K is committed to providing door-to-door transportation for all program outings and experiences for participants. We envision that all grant funding will enable us to purchase, wrap, insure, store, maintain, and operate two fifteen-passenger vans to be used for the transportation of our middle and high school students to all program-related activities and meetings. We estimate the price of vans to be around $50,000.00 each with the cost of wrapping to be about $5,000.00 per van. The cost of parking, insurance, and maintenance are difficult to estimate, though we believe the price of parking to be roughly $75.00 per month.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Partnership 4 Kids is well-positioned to sustain two fifteen-passenger vans far beyond the grant period due to the financial and program development strategies which we are currently putting in place. Currently, P4K is a Type I supporting organization of the Omaha Community Foundation under section 509(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. We are completing eligibility requirements for becoming an independent 501(c)(3), which we anticipate will be finalized later this year. This status will increase our eligibility to apply for additional funding opportunities, strengthening our agency’s financial sustainability. Additionally, transportation is our second highest cost, just behind staff time. Owning two vans would eliminate the need to arrange vehicle rentals and significantly diminish the need to provide mileage reimbursement to staff who, currently, use their personal vehicles for student transportation. P4K’s executive board is also developing new fundraising campaigns to increase revenue. As a future-focused organization, Partnership 4 Kids will remain committed to amplifying our financial assets by consistently increasing the number of grant requests submitted, unique supporters secured, and fundraising campaigns implemented annually.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> P4K works aggressively to secure grants from private foundations and corporations, making up the bulk of our annual revenue. Our only government grant is tied to AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps VISTA. AmeriCorps members are critical to the success of our organization. No fees are charged to students or families for participation. Other revenue sources include general donations, in-kind gifts, and a percentage of funds secured through events and fundraising campaigns. Burlington Capital provides a significant in-kind contribution for rent and utilities (secured) while postsecondary institutions, companies, etc. support student programming with transportation, meals, and other expenses (estimated pending based on historical in-kind revenue). There are no other funding sources secured or pending for the purchase of two fifteen-passenger vans as the purchasing, wrapping, and initial insuring of these vans will be a one-time expense.</p>
