  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> I would purchase at least 2 or more properties in North Omaha Census zone to rehab and either rent to family at affordable rate or sell to family at affordable rate.  We would work with city on this to find houses in desperate need of rehab, but can be saved as long as structure is sold.  I love North Omaha this is my community and I believe with my prior successes in previous deals and rehabs.  I could accomplish this with grant funds and with the city planning to make happen quickly.  I would be willing as investor to cover 10% of all costs and the remaining 90% in grant funding.  This would allow us to keep costs in line for affordable housing.  I have a team of contractors that do quality work at affordable rates and could get jobs done effectively in a timely manner.  Further details can be worked out to help the affordable housing crisis we are now having in North Omaha.</p>
