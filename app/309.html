  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> This project provides housing with onsite daycare and wrap-around social support services for single-parent students and their children. The result is improved long-term outcomes for these families, and improved capacity for local government housing resources.
The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness estimated that there are about 2,400 homeless Nebraskans and about 1,000 homeless students. The Benny Street Four Plex provides a safe affordable housing for residents of the North Omaha 68110 zip code. According to 2020 Statistics, this is the most poverty-stricken area of the city. Additional housing on a otherwise on occupied lot establishes more residents and per capital spending in the neighborhood leading to enhanced stimulation of the local area.</p>
