  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The goal of this project is to help transform the appearance of this neighborhood. As I mentioned earlier this lot has been vacant for years. A new modern development will help advance the efforts Holy Name is currently doing in the area. The Devine one project brings a mix in this neighborhood of already populated single family homes. There are more rentals in this neighborhood when it use to be more homeownership. This project addresses homeownership for long lasting economic goals while building generational wealth.

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> My community’s household median income level is less than 25,000 dollars. I live work and serve in this community. I know all to well how the goal of homeownership can seem like just a dream while making minimal wages trying to raise a family. When you make these wages there is obstacles to keep your income. Those obstacles can be childcare, transportation, and safe housing. Devine, one addresses all these obstacles creating connectivity it is on a bus line, blocks away from several childcare facilities all in walking distance. There is grocery stores near by and a local clinic on the same bus line. These key components I have thought through for a long time. I just never understood how I could make this dream work for my community. 
During covid this is the area was impacted losing their homes and being evicted. Devine, one addresses stable housing, and addresses the infrastructure building in density.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Devine one aligns with providing substainable affordable housing</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Devine one’s economic impact will stay in the community and city. It stops large companies from out of state buying up the land and properties. These companies drive up rental prices, drive out the community members, and take the money to their city. Devine one will hire and partner with those in the community. This will continue stable well-paying construction jobs again keeping the dollars in our community and city. I will accept bids first from businesses in the qualified census track areas. It creates livability in this area.</p>
