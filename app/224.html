  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> I have always had the passion to help the North Omaha Area.  In 2020 I hosted a community cleanup in partnership with Seventy five North that started at 4201 N. 30th street to 2112 N. 30th St. We also partnered with Keep Omaha Beautiful who sponsored the community cleanup.  Along with participating in other community cleanups with Cherita Dailey who hosted several community cleanups at Omaha parks & recreations. I would like to include that I am a breast cancer Survivor.  I believe that this proposal will allow me to empower, educate, and inspire other breast cancer patients and survivors.  Especially since breast cancer is rarely talked about in our community through our community.  Because there are so many disparities in the North Omaha Community, I would like to see funding support these issues to provide awareness and access to quality medical care.  In September of 2020, I participated in a project with Creighton University.  The project was aimed at Survivors views of personal "practical distress" and community level structural distress.  This research project aimed at understanding Black cancer distress in particular communities like North Omaha.  Following Oct. 21, 2020. Creighton created a project called DIANE (Dialogues for Innovative Action and Neighborhood Everywhere).  This project entailed with Interprofessional health students to understand and problem solve for the communities they work in.  We discussed that health is not merely the absence of disease, but the complete sense of physical, mental, and social well-being.  Therefore discussing my health experiences and how they were impacted by transportation, education, food security, housing, criminal justice, and/or culture which was part of the dialogue.</p>
