  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>

Revenue Generation Circulation of Currency
 Still Poppin Gourmet Popcorn shops locally for vendors and our raw materials used to produce our product. For items we can not produce we are strategic and intentional about obtaining these services from minority owned small businesses. The capital generated from our business returns to our community. This will help keep money circulation in and through our community .The will sustain our business and create economic growth.

Local jobs

Due to the lack of local opportunities, Native Omahans are leaving Nebraska at extremely high rates. Still Poppins goal is to assist with creating a thriving small business infrastructure that will encourage our people to stay.  Throughout the phases of our project our goal is to employ 70+ people from our community. These jobs will pay a liveable wage and give employees opportunities for growth and advancement. The jobs will be in their neighborhood so work is closer to home. 
 
Tax

Our vision is to become a multimillion dollar business operating in North Omaha. This generated revenue will convert to local taxes fueling our local economy. This will go directly to our school districts, our roads that need to be improved, our small business/


Community Culture 

Our goal is to assist with the framing  of a positive identity for North Omaha. We believe that it is imperative to show that black owned businesses can survive and thrive in our community. This was done in the past before the riots and it is important to reflect on our history as a BLACK PRINT (not blue) on how our community can thrive once again. Still Poppin being a successful business in North Omaha will help to shape the character of our community. Increasing community pride is our objective. Still Poppin Gourmet Popcorn is a a black owned brand  that is born, cultivated, and harvested in North Omaha We are a part of the community culture Our goals is to bring local and national attention to North Omaha This will create a sense of community and pride. When people travel to Houston they want Turkey Hut. When people travel to Chicago they are looking for Garrents. When people come to Omaha they will seek Still Poppinâ€™s Omaha Mix (and other unique flavors)!  Still Poppin will also assist with the community culture by continue to grow our fundraising program. Youth and organizations in our community  sell popcorn to rais money for uniforms, sports equipment, travel and competitions. Teams keep 50% of the profits.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The proposal contributes to community sustainability through jobs creations. Job creations assist with growth of our North Omaha economy. If employees are working close to home they are buying gas close to home, shopping close to home. This keeps the money in our community longer. The community will get a sense of pride having successful minority owned business in the neighborhood.</p>
