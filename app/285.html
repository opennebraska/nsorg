  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Results Sports & Fitness Training is designed to provide first-class training for athletes of all sports in the North and South Omaha metro areas.  We are looking to expand our athletic training capabilities.  We believe that branding a consistent skill training program will allow young people to develop a discipline that is necessary for a long and healthy life and teach lessons on work ethic that carry into all aspects of achieving their future goals and aspirations.  We believe our community core values will enhance our ability to develop children and help them build a strong and healthy lifestyle for their future.  Results Sports & Fitness will bring an elite sports training platform to all including underserved neighborhoods throughout the Omaha community.  We have been running our training through various schools throughout the North and South Omaha metro areas and would like to expand this training to be afforded by more throughout the community without sacrificing our quality training, for which we need funding for our operating fees and equipment.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Our timeline is set to achieve our goal of 540 athletes being trained by Dec 31, 2025.  Given the affordable rate we will be able to offer with this proposal, we have confidence to reach 360 athletes by Dec 31, 2023 and 450 athletes by Dec 31, 2024.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 0.9159999999999999</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our program helps meet the sustainable community needs through enhancing services and recreation by offering high-level athletic training to those in North and South Omaha.  This coincides with the quality of life needs that it improves the offerings of many athletic spaces within this community.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This is an opportunity to bridge all athletes in the North and South Omaha areas.  There is a collective goal to enhance the athletic culture in both areas while connecting our business with several spaces and economic sectors throughout the area.  We are a black owned company based out of North Omaha that provides a safe training area that helps athletes get off of the streets and invest time and effort into themselves, thus teaching them the importance of working hard toward meeting goals.  This is an opportunity to serve those needing economic support, with roughly 4,050 of North and South High School’s student population on free and reduced lunch throughout the 2021-22 school year.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal aligned with several aspects within LB1024’s strategic priorities.  It serves those in low social and economic status, while mending the racial segregation and further enhancing all peoples within the North and South Omaha areas.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> This specifically immediately enhances athletes in the North and South Omaha area and their families as the kids have a safe place to go and invest time into themselves while working toward their ambitions.  However, the skills and ethics taught through our trainings can be taken out of the sports world and assist them throughout their lively endeavors, thus impacting the community as a whole.</p>
