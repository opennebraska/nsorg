  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Multi-pronged Community Economic Development Project will serve as the site for business development and job creation that will support the economic and social integration, and the financial independence, of low-income families.  We are planning to build on the same site a Global Market, a commercial kitchen, a tortilla factory and 75 apartments ranging from 1-3 bedrooms. 
Eager to create new opportunities for South Omaha, four organizations came together to stablish a partnership which is working for the transformation, the fundamental change and the long-lasting economic growth of the South Omaha community.  
Collective Development is a real estate investment and property management company located in Omaha. Their portfolio consists of 500 primarily residential units that range from single-family houses, duplexes/town homes, apartments, and mixed-use buildings including a brewery. 

No More Empty Pots strives to support communities in becoming self-sufficient and food secure through collaboration and adherence to their core values.  They have built two commercial kitchen food hubs in Omaha. 

Community Investment Opportunities (CIO) is leading the Global Market. This market will develop and maintain a place that builds upon the economic, social and cultural assets with the different ethnic communities in order to bring these communities together. People of the Midwest will come to enjoy food, entertainment, shopping and rich cultural experiences

3 Amigas is a food processing company. They have experience in food processing and manufacturing. Elia, Adela and Guillermina are planning to build a tortilla factory at the Global Market. 

CIO has a property located at 5025 South 33rd street. The total site area of this property is 5.53 acres with a sf of 246,740. CIO has a purchase agreement with a company.  If they do not complete the purchase of this building, our first option would be to build the mixed-use project there. 
Total Budget for the first phase of the project will be $22,600,000.00. The group will fund 59% of this total and they are expecting to apply for a grant for 41% of the total. We will develop the first phase of this project before October 2026.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> If a site is acquired by spring/summer of 2023, and this grant funding is secured, it is realistic that architectural, engineering and city approvals can be approved in the fall and winter so that construction can begin in spring of 2024. Assuming those dates, July 2025 is an attainable goal for completion. We will develop the first phase of our development before July  2026.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Multi-pronged Community Economic Development Project clearly addresses the following needs:  sustainable community, quality of life, job creation, and minority businesses development.
In the area of sustainable community, we are looking to fill the following needs for the community in South Omaha: housing, food, retail/commercial, entertainment, recreation, parking and multi-use. In the area of quality of life our project is working to create mixed use facilities and garden areas. 
This public market develops small businesses and celebrates community diversity through a one-of-a-kind shopping, dining, and cultural venue with products from many nations.
Vision of the project: People from various cultures sharing their customs, food and culture with the community. The Global Market will be a community development project that will serve as small business incubator for fledgling local entrepreneurs. The plan calls for an equal mix of (33%) start-ups, second-stage businesses, and anchor businesses, with the goal of 40 permanent vendors. These vendors will sell food, arts and crafts and other items from the various cultures that populate greater Omaha area. Tenants must be part of a cooperative, receive training and technical assistance in order to be in the project. They will also participate in the design of the project.

The Global Market will be a place where the community can share and interact with friends. In this place, people will find food from different parts of the world, fruits and fresh vegetables, arts, crafts, jewelry, clothing and other articles would be needed by the community. The Global market will have a large parking lot and be designed to reflect the cultures included in the market. 

Community Investment Opportunities LLC (CIO) purchased a property located at 5025 South 33rd street, Omaha, NE 68107. The total site area of this property is 5.53 acres with a building of 246,740 square feet. 
Environmental studies phases 1 and 2 were made for the project. Conclusions of these studies were:  
Solar energy and other sustainable technologies are part of the educational projects that CIO plans to implement. The goal is to demonstrate the possibilities and potential use of environmentally sustainable practices to limit contamination of soil, air, and water. 
During 2022 we formed a partnership between 4 organizations for the development of the project. These companies and non-profit organizations are: Collective Development, No More Empty Pots, Community Investments Opportunities (CIO), and 3 Amigas for the development of the tortilla factory. We will analyze with Nancy William the development of the commercial kitchen in South Omaha and how this project would affect the income of No More Empty Pots. 
Phase 1 of the project is to develop a commercial kitchen, public food court, restaurants, entertainment for families and a tortilla factory. This will be developed on the third floor. A new entrance at grade level will be developed. In an attachment, please find the first phase of the project. We will evaluate the possibility of building 75 apartments at floor 2 in the first phase. 
Phase 2 of the project is to develop a commercial shopping center and events and conference center and retail space. This will be developed on the third floor. In an attachment, please find plans for phase 1 and 2 of the project. 
Phase 3 will develop light manufacturing spaces on the third floor. Other possibilities of development: meeting rooms, immigrant center for several non-profit organizations, offices, dance academies, areas to practice sports, innovation center, and cultural spots.
Phase 4 will create parking on the first floor.
If we sell the CIO building, we will develop a new property with a building for housing next to the global market.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> South Omaha has a strong small business community and its culture cultivates local 
The 24th Street and Vinton business districts have vibrant small business, but they are at risk and/or they have problems with funding their development. Theses business owners are coming from countries where business practices are different. They need to learn and adopt the business practices in the United States.  The majority of them are family-owned businesses and they are afraid to hire staff because they do not know how to manage payroll. Parking is a serious problem in these business districts. 
Microenterprise businesses have emerged as a major strategy that offers a pathway out of poverty through their ability to create new jobs.  However, the most difficult obstacle faced by these businesses is lack of access to affordable capital.  Many of these businesses are self-funded by accessing their home equity, or through credit cards, or high interest debt that limits their opportunities for sustainability or growth.  


Barriers exist for small food-based enterprises to start-up or expand.  Many begin in a home kitchen but as the business grows, the residential kitchen is no longer appropriate to accommodate large-scale production.  Challenges faced by these businesses include lack of access to affordable, commercially licensed, industrial-sized kitchen space; high cost of capital investment required to formalize a food production business, lack of technical support and business assistance with cost analysis, business planning, packaging, product line expansion, and marketing resources. 

ARPA funds will enable our partnership of organizations to address these needs by developing the commercial kitchen, and helping these entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses while creating and sustaining jobs for low-income persons.

We have an important advantage in the development of our project. Entrepreneurs are working with a cooperative model in Community Investments Opportunities. This gives us the opportunity to provide them with the tools that they need to be successful in their businesses. They need to receive training and technical assistance to be part of the Global Market. These entrepreneurs are owners of the property of the Global Market. At the present time, they are paying high rental rates because the majority of the commercial properties belong to only two property management companies in the area. They will pay rent but at the same time, they will be owners of the building.  They will optimize cost because they share spaces such as bathrooms, storage areas, the cost of marketing and support in the administration of the building. 

We are building our complex upon the existing entrepreneurial vibrancy and demand as well as the diversity of culture and talent which can be leveraged. We will have periodical cultural events, farmer markets, flea markets, concerts in the Global Market as well as other community activities.  In the future, we will build an auditorium and a space for meetings and other events. You can see the dimensions of this space for important events stated in the plans that we are attaching to this application. 

We are planning to develop a building with 75 apartments next to the Global Market. This will contribute to the need for new housing in South Omaha by increasing the inventory of available rental properties. 

Our commercial kitchen will work to ensure food safety and to limit food disparities.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal contributes fully to respond to the pandemic and its economic effects and to build a stronger, more equitable economy during the recovery. South Omaha Multi-pronged Community Economic Development Project contributes to the solution of the negative economic impacts that COVID-19 generated in the communities of color in South Omaha. We will create new jobs, support the startup and growth of minority businesses, train and give technical assistance to food processing companies, train the entrepreneurs and the community about the production of safe and healthy food. And we will build new apartments to increase the number of rental properties in South Omaha. One of the items presented by the community at the hearings was the issue of older and singular type housing stock in South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> First phase of the project will be planning. In this phase, we could have 4 permanent jobs. Considering architects, engineers, legal assistant, and 1 general contractor, we can have 6 contractors working in the project in 2023.   We will have entrepreneurs in different areas and companies that provide rental houses and apartments, companies providing insurance, companies involved in food processing and catering, companies manufacturing clothing, companies concentrating on tax preparation and real estate services, and contractors of many different types.   We can create special discount plans or packages of services for the people that are part of this amazing project. For example, Collective Development will provide quality housing opportunities to those who work in No More Empty Pots, or a business associated with the commercial and light manufacturing companies, and they can offer a 10-15% discount to those workers and businesses which are affiliated with the project. The vision is to build a cohesive community surrounding the commercial aspect of the project.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> By increasing the sense of community in an area and providing a space that people within the community are proud of.

Companies are very proud to say that they care about the environment and look for ways to contribute to its benefit. For example, Rivera’s Mexican Food LLC is currently using sustainable food packaging to ship its salsa to online customers. This eliminates waste.
The commercial kitchen will train food processing companies about food safety. This was one of one of the concerns presented by the community in the hearings. 

CIO worked on a plan named ENVIROMENTAL IMPROVEMENT DESMOSTRATION PROJECT. CIO wants to create an example of what can be done to a building to provide energy that is clean and sustainable, and does not depend upon the use of fossil fuels. As an adjunct to this effort rainwater will be diverted to storage tanks for use that will support the rooftop gardens.  

The philosophy of CIO is to create an environmental oasis that can become an educational site to teach the preservation of our atmosphere through the use of solar energy and other sustainable technologies.

Community Investment Opportunities LLC believes in the philosophy that as human beings, we all are charged with the responsibility of protecting and enhancing our environment.  The group believes that this is a moral and ethical obligation owed to present and future generations.  Protection of the environment is a matter of education.  We must educate adults and children alike that this duty to society must be made a part of our lives and culture.  This philosophy must be made a part of the formal education of our children from their earliest education in elementary school through college.  

Our future lies with our children and the level of environmental awareness we can teach them.  We must do more than simply teaching theories and possibilities.  We must demonstrate that sustainable clean renewable energy will be critical to their future.  This requires that we are able to reproduce the benefits of our efforts to show persons who will become more and more dependent on electricity in their daily lives in the future that it is possible now.

The importance of clean air and clean water are basic to our lives.  We must teach our children that each person is responsible for the cleanliness of our environment.  In our society, the increase in the amount and severity of asthma and other pulmonary problems in our children is frightening.  There is no viable life without clean air and clean water.  Recent reports state that 3000 persons in China die due to air pollution each day.  Millions of persons die each year due to the lack of clean drinking water.  As an advanced society, we have a great responsibility to educate and aid persons in creating a clean environment for us all.  

Due to the location of the property next to the Metropolitan Community College, CIO will build an educational experience so that students and the general public can see what can be done to preserve our environment.  These efforts will use Kiosks presenting videos of the entire process to from beginning to end.  CIO also hopes to form a partnership with the college to teach solar energy technology and other renewable sources of energy production.

This would allow students of the Metropolitan community college and other area colleges, as well as the general public, to be educated as to possibilities and great potential of the uses of renewable energy sources.  Persons would be able to visit the project site and observe the creation of a beautiful building using the most advanced green technology.

CIO plans to build a large solar energy array on the roof of the building. We have a study for the implementation of this project (Please review the study in an attachment)</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Multi-pronged Community Economic Development Project will be a development that fits with the cultural context of the South Omaha community.  We will build a destination place where people from the Midwest will enjoy music, cultural activities, and good food. Furthermore, people will be able to shop for articles from many different parts of the world. Las Americas Global Market will be the first public market in the state of Nebraska. The small businesses within the commercial component have unlimited potential for growth and this project will provide a melting pot of ideas and a supportive culture for those entrepreneurs.  The commercial aspect of the project will be absolutely unique. The housing component will compliment other mixed-use areas found in Omaha; think Blackstone, Benson, the Old Market, among others.</p>

  <h3>DisplacementExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> The first option to develop the project is a property located at 5025 S 33rd Street, Omaha, NE 68107. CIO has signed a Purchase Agreement with a company with operations in the area. Our first option for the development of our project is this property.  The total land area of this property is 5.5 acres and the building has 250,000 square feet.  This building in the past was a packing company (Conagra) and then a cold storage business.

If we complete the sale of this property to the purchasing company, we will purchase another property in South Omaha. We will purchase a property to renovate or a bare piece of land to start development of new buildings. One of the big threats for development in South Omaha is the limited land for growth and small parcels. Our real estate agents in the project are concentrated on the task of finding a suitable property for the development of the project. This will be a long-term project and several organizations will participate in purchasing the space that they need for the development of their own projects. Ideally, we are looking for a site of approximately 5 acres.</p>
