  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> I do not know</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> I would like to obtain space at 2552 N. 24th Street as a building industry innovation HUB, including 3D printing materials, as well as an advocacy resource for neglected properties with HUB Zones (historically underutilized business) zones. A place where there could be continuous dialogue between professionals within the A/E/C (Architectural, Engineering, and Construction) industries and the communities they effect to reduce the negative effects of gentrification.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Dec 2022-find out about Activate Fellowship opportunity. The Fellowship begins June 1, 2023. They provide mentorship of setting benchmarks and meeting them.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Historic preservation is one of the ‘greenest’ professions available. Reusing the existing building stock will reduce the drastic effects of mass mining the Earth for new building materials.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The social impact of having and preserving information about some of USA’s oldest architectural pearls will create advocacy to not further destroy these structures, which the materials end up in landfills.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Documenting neglected buildings keeps what is left of American architectural heritage intact. Researching properties and finding out what they used to look like and using the local small business contractors or even volunteers to make the properties look how they were originally intended would reduce blight. Fair procurement processes would also be implemented to contract with local small businesses.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> 10 jobs, permanently ($15/hr), provide a fair and equitable procurement process for the City of Omaha Tier I & Tier II Businesses to be commissioned as regular independent contractors.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Commission the City of Omaha Tier I & Tier II Businesses as regular independent contractors.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The CBDC would be the Facilities Management HQ to effectively provide positive, visual change to the built environment of HUB Zone communities and reduce blight.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Documenting and recording the most neglected historic building stocks is a start to give them a second chance at being homes for local, organic, germane, viable community businesses to exercise their entrepreneurial skills and test their product(s).</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Demonstrating how old and new buildings can coexist and still take advantage of historic tax credits.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> An increased number of minority architects licensed in the State of Nebraska.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Through NOMA (National Organization of Minority Architects).</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes. When a community has an accurate knowledge of its existing real estate stock, this knowledge is power at leveraging interested investors to provide jobs to the local community.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> National Organization of Minority Architects (ACADIA) (architectural drafting arm). Help to record (all of the conditions) of the historic building stock of East Omaha.</p>
