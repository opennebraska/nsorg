  <h3>ProposalType</h3>

Service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Valuable on-site support services as commercial tenants, including childcare and early childhood education, and life skills and career counseling. The result is three-fold:
•	Better economic outcomes for the parents who get the support they need to finish school and increase upward mobility;
•	Better educational outcomes for the children, resulting in two generations lifted from poverty at one time; and,
•	With the capacity to house 80 participants and their dependent children at one time, Scholar house will help decrease the backlog of families waiting for housing through Section 8.
Scholar House aligns with the essential purpose of ARPA by creating a road to sustainable work and wealth for the citizens of Omaha with the lowest median income. With Scholar House located in the ARPA impact area, the project will bring short-term jobs for the duration of the project as well as long-term jobs helping to administer the childcare and counseling services provided on-site.</p>

With Scholar House located in the ARPA impact area, the project will bring short-term jobs for the duration of the project as well as long-term jobs helping to administer the childcare and counseling services provided on-site.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Scholar House makes use of existing vacant property in North Omaha (the proposed location  and creates investment and development in North Omaha without displacing existing members of the community. Rather, the beneficiaries of the Scholar House program are some of the community’s most vulnerable to housing insecurity: single-income parents and their children. Recognizing that North Omaha is a multi-generational community, Scholar House intentionally improves outcomes for both parent and child—two generations at a time—to impact the community far into the future.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> in alignment with essential element of 1024 imitative to create sustainable housing, jobs and income in the uninvested areas if Omaha Ne.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We estimate the job impact to be as follows:
•	Approximately 14-16 permanent jobs created (on-site childcare workers, social workers/counseling staff, building maintenance/custodial and security, property management and leasing staff.)
•	Approximately 30  temporary/construction jobs
•	The overwhelming majority of temporary and long-term jobs are skilled labor positions, paying wages in the range of $35K+/year</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> the number will increase over the years as graduate of the Scholar house enter the work force.</p>

  <p> 30 to 50</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> 35 thousand dollars to 60 thousand dollars a years.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> via additional projects of the same nature.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Scholar House will be a beacon of innovative economic development with the North Omaha community in which it will be located. By helping to increase the educational attainment and earning potential of participants, Scholar House will contribute to the upward mobility of some of Omaha’s most economically underserved residents. By making wrap-around social services accessible to participants (e.g. counseling and early childhood education), the program creates lasting change while creating both residential and commercial opportunities.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Increased jobs and increased housing stability.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Scholar House offers the best of both worlds, being a highly innovative concept first developed and implemented about ten years agon in Kentucky. At the same time, the program has been repeated and standardized over the past ten years, making it a reliable approach with ample best practices and support provided through the Scholar House Affiliate Programs network.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Outcomes we propose to measure are: •	Post-secondary degree completion and GPA •	Employment after program completion •	Gross annual income before and after program completion •	Children’s kindergarten and first grade achievement scores compared to the average in their school district</p>

The property belongs to the Salvation Army and is located near the Salvation Army Community Center Corp. Given the short turnaround deadline for this proposal, MOU has not yet been achieved. Several organizations have expressed interest in partnering with the project but are somewhat opposed to drafting such an agreement at this stage in the process. I am actively working with Mid Land Charities, Salvation Army and a couple of local colleges to establish relationships.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Given the standardization of the Scholar House Program, it is noted that it is also very transferable and adaptable.  The Program could be used to house jail-released individuals in a halfway house setting. The residents would have perquisites, including Section 8, and going to school, perhaps trade and construction school at Metro Tech with the requirement of working in Omaha Construction for 2 years after completion of the program. These employees would then be available to work in the construction boom that is exploding in Omaha. The Project is also feasible at 1.37 acers located at 24th and Burndette. The City Owns the Property and I have made a request to purchase the land and I’m working with City Planning regrading this issue as well as zoning.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> Tax credits model will be used in leu of Salvation Army Commitment.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The organizational support of this project ensures an enduring future. Scholar House brings together the power of government, commercial and nonprofit organizations working to alleviate poverty and stimulate economic development into one location where participants can live, social services organizations can connect with and serve their target populations and credible childcare businesses can establish tenancy and a consistent customer base. The program is a win/win/win and will prove to be a profitable use of the space.</p>
