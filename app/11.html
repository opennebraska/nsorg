  <h3>TeamExplanation</h3>
  <p> Jamie Gutierrez, Lori Elkins EA, Marylin Oldaker EVP, outside Team members have been interviewed for this project specifically</p>

  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> I have uploaded MM's Org chart.  MMR is also managed by this company although not specifically noted.  I plan to create a team of resources and have already been talking and working with Alley Poyner, White Lotus Arun and Jay, Canopy South Cesar Garcia, Bridget Bumgardner Boyd Jones, Sam Garden CBRE,  Todd Swerzic & Jay Noddle of Noddle Companies.  These are possible additions to our team.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Midwest Maintenance Co's headquarters is located on the corner of 29th and Q streets. Our main office building has been renovated twice and currently serves as our headquarters. We have accumulated some properties on this block built a warehouse,   parking lots, renovated other buildings, and created some green space.  We have opted to keep our headquarters office in South Omaha and it has been my dream and vision to create and develop a space that would draw people to South Omaha to enjoy the culture in this area. Something similar to Blackstone or midtown would be a wonderful growth opportunity for South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> Q Metro</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 40000000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 35000000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> We are committed to the revitalizing of Q street as a major commercial corridor.  We are committed to the re-development and improvement of Southside Terrace and Indian Hill neighborhoods in South Omaha effected by the pandemic alongside and in collaboration and support of Canopy South & the Q Street corridor revitalization partnership.  
Durning the pandemic Midwest Maintenance Co lost nearly 75% of its revenue and Midwest Maintenance Realty halted all development projects.  We have been focusing on regaining MM business and are finally starting to recover.  This grant opportunity will help MMR get back on track with our development plans. 
Our first phase consists of a new headquarters building where Midwest Maintenance Co would be housed.  It will be a five story mixed-use facility with storefronts on the main level, some underground or main level parking, office space on second and third levels, and market rate or affordable housing apartments above. The height of the building would have nice city views. Our current facility at 29 & Q, will be converted to a shared office space for entrepreneurs & start up companies to share conference and break rooms, reception areas, etc. while still having private office space.  The third phase would be to add restaurants, store space and community gathering hubs on other properties we own.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> We could start June of 2023 and be completed by the end of 2025.  this would give us time to start phase 3 in 2026</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 0.93</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> I believe keeping Midwest Maintenance Companies Inc. HQ in south Omaha would be a tremendous asset to this community. Our company, which is now working in seven states, would give needed recognition to the value of location. Our first building with office & mixed use space, would be a great use for the community adding needed gathering space, coffee shops such as we see at north 75.  Community orgs and local businesses can meet and gather in these areas. The location is right off the interstate which gives easy access for storefront retailers' clientele. MM current HQ will be converted to shared office space a great location for growing entrepreneurs and start ups. The project is essential for positive economic impact in South Omaha and Omaha in general.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The vision workshop leaves lots of room for growing nonprofits and services. I believe our vision for economic development fills the gap for business development and economic growth. Our vision also encourages careers, jobs, and individual wealth management serving the needs of the community for job opportunities.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal helps local South O businesses recover from the pandemic strain.  Keeping MM HQ in South Omaha and developing space for more business and community growth will not only greatly contribute to the recovery of the economy, but will allow for sustainable growth and scaling.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Our project is in line with the scaling of our company & other businesses in South O.  It provides more office space for our growing management staff, and other departmental growth. We need coffee shops, restaurants, etc for our employees to frequent. The project provides a space for other companies in the area to gather, hold meetings, and frequent retailers, health care needs, stores and restaurants.  This project includes attractive housing needed for local employees from our company and other companies / agencies in the area such as One World, Phillips, Greater Omaha Packing, etc. encouraging walking sites to work - home - retail - church, etc.
The shared office space allows for entrepreneurs to be in a reasonably priced office with a great location, and easy access to downtown and west Omaha.  Basically this development creates a multitude of jobs, job training and higher wage opp for this area.</p>

  <p> approximately $16/hour to $50+/hour</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Our HQ alone will allow us to double our management staff and hire more employees.   It is known that companies that stay and grow in their neighborhoods, hire, provide and grow the community where it lives</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> this project will benefit the community by thriving in the area, creating more jobs, job training, higher paying job opportunities and supporting local non profits which directly serve the people in this community.  improving the economy promotes healthy surrounding neighborhoods and attraction to the area</p>

  <p> we are proposing an eco friendly green building with a "no trash" concept.  we are also allowing for green space and outdoor park areas</p>

  <p> this project will create more job training opportunities, education, and high wage job opportunities.  our company has all depts including HR, Finance, Sales, Marketing, Operations, National Sales, and more.  therefore we need all levels of jobs that will be located at our HQ on Q street.</p>
