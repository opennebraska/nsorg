  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Home Team Auto Sales (HTAS) is a car dealership and repair center located in the North Omaha Qualified Census Tract. In business for the past 5 years, HTAS has offered quality pre-owned vehicles and service to the local community. To expand the much-needed services to the community, HTAS purchased the building next door to its current location, making the beginning phase of this proposal shovel ready as ownership of the first two buildings is complete. This duo will now acquire the 2nd two parcels in order to complete phase 2 of the proposal, which is to create the first black owned large-scale dealership and service center within the North Omaha area, allowing the team to continue to help those within this marginalized community get to success through transportation. Along with this capital project, HTAS has began creating the 360 program which provides financial literacy through the education of the car transaction and car care clinic. We are working to close the knowledge Gap! This in turn will have a direct and immediate impact on lessening the wealth gap.

This project will provide 11 Full-time Meaningful Wage Jobs along with several part-time opportunities for high-school aged individuals, along with numerous temporary jobs with specific focus to hire those residing in the North Omaha QCT throughout the construction period.
