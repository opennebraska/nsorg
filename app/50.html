  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The Women’s Center for Advancement (WCA) manages several multi-year, large-scale federal and government grants – approximately $2.1 million in federal funds and $300,000 in state, county, and city funding, annually. Government funding accounts for approximately 50% of the revenue budget of the WCA. The grants include federal, state, and local funds:
•	Federal - Consolidated Youth and Engaging Men (CYEM), Legal Assistance for Victims (LAV), Office for Victims of Crime (OVC)
•	State - Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy (NCPA), Health and Human Services (HHS), Rape Prevention and Education (RPE), Office of Violence Against Women, STOP Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), Violence of Crime Act (VOCA), Improving Criminal Justice Response (ICJR), Office of Violence Against Women (OVW)
•	Local - City of Omaha Community Services grant, Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (SAKI), and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG-CV)

Serving over 4,100 clients in 2021, the need for services is high. Once their immediate safety is ensured, WCA case managers provide clients with the tools they need to live stable, autonomous lives – addressing a sequence of basic needs that lead to a client’s ability to obtain and sustain housing, employment, and financial independence. The WCA provides services in programs other than Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security, such as Safety Services, Education/Prevention, and Housing.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Women’s Center for Advancement (WCA) uses a holistic approach to assist victims/survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking with becoming independent and self-reliant. The WCA is located at 38th and Harney, near the Qualified Census Tracts, and serving mostly clients from QCTs.

A very low-income (often no income) population, the largest barrier to leaving an abuser is often financial independence. Many times the abuser has managed or maintained power over the victim/survivor’s employment, financial status, and spending. Victims/survivors feel lost – lacking confidence in their marketable employment skills, access to healthcare, isolation from friends/family, and significant concerns over caring for children/dependents on their own. For these reasons, the Self-Sufficiency Program at the WCA is a critical component of our mission. It strengthens the competency and capacity of victims/survivors in financial literacy, career readiness, and knowledge/access of community resources. 

The Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program offered to victims/survivors (at no cost) include financial individualized case management, empowerment group, access and education to information technology skills, getting ahead classes, career and resume workshops, and a clothing boutique. The clothing boutique is stocked with new or like-new business clothes for women entering the workforce. Case managers teach victims/survivors critical life skills such as communication style, professionalism, conflict management, and critical thinking. Resume workshops, mock interviews, access to computers for skill-building and job hunting, referrals, and career fairs are all important elements of the agency’s efforts in preparing clients for employment. 

The COVID-19 pandemic forced many victims/survivors to stay with abusers longer than they might have because of stay-in-place orders. Our agency saw a drastic increase in calls to our hotline as the pandemic restrictions lifted in 2021. At the same time that we had an increased need for emergency services, our funding was limited due to canceled fundraising events and our greatest need was often funding to provide direct client assistance. Self-Sufficiency includes financial individualized case management, empowerment group, access and education to information technology skills, getting ahead classes, career and resume workshops, and connection to job placement/workforce development programs. It is critical in helping victims/survivors permanently leave abusive situations.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Clients who are admitted to the Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program will have created safety goals and completed a self-sufficiency matrix upon intake.

Once these initial goals are established, clients are continually monitored and reevaluated. The goals monitored include: 1) every client working with a self-sufficiency case manager will take the self-sufficiency assessment, 2) based on their unique assessment, each client will work with their case manager to develop a case plan with action steps, 3) clients participating in follow-up appointments, classes, and workshops will show progress toward meeting the goals defined in their case plan. This is measured by having clients retake the initial assessment at 30-90 day intervals and looking to see how scores have improved.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program aligns directly with the community needs identified by the Omaha Economic Recovery Act by, specifically Sustainable Community:
•	Enhancing and increasing services for individuals in becoming workforce-ready
•	Providing financial literacy classes and case management services

•	Connecting victims/survivors with temp agencies and workforce programs
•	Assisting victims/survivors with finding short and long term housing, including our Rapid Rehousing Program</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Visioning Workshop Summary showcased needs from workforce development to mental health to housing support. The WCA provides all three of these needs to victims/survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault. 

Workforce Development - The Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program addresses the critical need of financial independence from abusers experienced by survivors of domestic violence. The general public often thinks of domestic violence in terms of physical abuse. But domestic violence weapons defined by the Nebraska Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence are physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and financial abuse. Barriers to self-sufficiency include unemployment, lack of job skills, lack of access to transportation and community resources, isolation, and untreated behavioral health needs. The Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program helps survivors get back on their feet financially and builds applicable skills, self-esteem, and connections to community resources. 

Mental Health – The WCA staff intends to hire three Licensed Mental Health Practitioners to assist those recovery from trauma with the mental health support needed to become self-sufficient, independent, and strong, after a major life event such as domestic abuse or sexual assault.

Housing Support - The WCA’s Housing program provides critical emergency housing support for victims/survivors of domestic violence in the wake of an attack or as they flee an abuser. Domestic violence is the leading cause of homelessness for women resulting in between 22% and 57% of homeless episodes. These statistics are even higher for women of color and trans/non-binary women (National Network to End Domestic Violence, 2019, https://nnedv.org/resources-library/h_domestic-violence-housing-homelessness/). Recognizing the critical importance of housing in helping victims/survivors leave abusive situations, the WCA began a Rapid Rehousing Program during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024’s strategically prioritizes housing projects, job training programs, and business development. This is in direct alignment with the WCA’s Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program, which includes a workforce program (“Tech Bootcamp) in collaboration with AIM Institute, job readiness programs, job referrals, and housing.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> This program will create new job training opportunities for victims/survivors to train for the workforce, providing them with the skills and opportunities they need to be successful.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Victims/survivors in the Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program will be encouraged to seek employment with businesses and contracts in the Qualified Census Tracts. Most of our clients live within or adjacent to the QCTs.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program is a critical component to ensuring victims/survivors are empowered to leave an abusive situation. Serving over 4,100 clients in 2021, the need for services is high. 

The Self-Sufficiency approach is two-pronged: 1) providing basic financial literacy and life skills important to becoming self-reliant and 2) providing career tools to obtain and sustain gainful employment. The collaboration with AIM Institute will give victims/survivors the tools to start more lucrative careers and improve their long-term outcomes towards independence.  

These skills provide tremendous community benefit – first by providing those most vulnerable in society with the opportunities for success and independence. And secondarily, by assisting victims/survivors with workforce opportunities which provide employers with smart, resilient, strong staff.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Approximately 34% of women and 28% of men experience domestic violence and/or sexual assault in Nebraska during their lifetime. In 2020 (the latest year available), Douglas County showed 533 reports of aggravated domestic violence and 2,954 simple domestic assaults (Nebraska Crime Commission, 2017-2020 crime assessment). Additionally, national data shows that one in ten women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted by a partner in her lifetime (Center for Disease Control, 2017). Almost 20% of women and 8% of men will be sexually assaulted other than raped by a partner in their lifetime. These numbers are significantly higher for women of color: 48% of American Indian women, 45% of Black women, and 34% of Hispanic women will experience sexual or physical violence by a partner in their lifetime (Center for Disease Control, 2017). Damage from victimization is severe, chronic, and costly, and it impacts the entire community. Community health and sustainability are reliant on ensuring a high qualify of life for all, particularly those most exposed to trauma.

The WCA responds locally to these critical needs by providing safety, financial, and empowerment services, in addition to other programs to victims/survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, and has seen the need increase due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Locally, calls to the WCA domestic violence and sexual assault hotline increased 34% in 2021 (11,178 in 2021 from 8,338 in 2020). Without providing employment assistance and financial stability programs, the likelihood of women leaving their abuser shrinks drastically – these services are life-saving and long-lasting.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> No one who requests services from the WCA is denied. To best serve the victims/survivors that need the WCA’s assistance, we must utilize innovative programs to provide workforce opportunities, mental health supports, and safety services. The WCA began a new program in 2022 in collaboration with the AIM Institute to provide a Tech Bootcamp to victims/survivors at no cost – including a stipend for childcare and transportation. Additionally, in a new program in collaboration with the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women, the WCA provides services to women in prison through the Prison Rape Elimination Act. The WCA staff is dedicated to outreach within the refugee communities (Syrian, Afghan, Burmese/Karen, South Sudanese, and others) and staff are trained on domestic partner violence in the LGBTQ community, as well. The WCA targets youth organizations for education and prevention programs.  As a best practice in equity outreach, the WCA has several bilingual hotline advocates that work with Spanish-speaking victims/survivors and all staff are culturally competent. Two staff also speak Arabic, Karen, and Indian dialects. The WCA utilizes Language Line for translation services outside of Spanish and English. Client assessments are routinely produced in Spanish and Arabic but can be customized to fit each unique victim/survivor’s language needs.   Because trauma has a profound effect on victims/survivors, particularly for people of color, the WCA prioritized implementing trauma-informed practices and procedures that are evaluated through a DEI lens and targeted to uniquely suit each population we work with. The WCA was selected by Trauma Matters Omaha to undergo an 18-24 month “Whole Systems Change” project that incorporates trauma-informed care into all policies and procedures. This whole-systems change is being led by the Trauma Stress Institute of Washington, D.C.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The short-term impact is measured by general outcomes: # of safety plans created # of protection orders filed # of clients using case management services # of clients that complete workforce development training  For the long-term impacts, we will measure the number of clients that continue in AIM’s Technology Workforce program in one of the five focus areas: coding, design, data management, tech support, and technology infrastructure. We will track the future employment of clients who complete the Code School and the stackable certifications they receive as a result of the completion of the program.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> A core component of the work of the WCA’s Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program is to connect victims/survivors to other resources in the community. These partnerships allow us to focus on helping victims/survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking and not overlap on programs already offered in the community. The Advocate/Case Manager assists the client with accessing other community resources not offered by the WCA which can include early childhood education and childcare, specific legal services not offered by the WCA legal services team, mental health supports, and substance abuse resources. Some of the partnerships the WCA regularly leverages include:  •	Nala House –a transitional housing program. •	Domestic Violence Assistance Fund (DVAP)  •	Sisters of Notre Dame  •	ENCAP, Together Inc., Heart Ministry, Heartland Hope Mission, and the Juan Diego Center •	Heartland Family Service (HFS), Catholic Charities, the Stephen Center, Open Door Mission, and Sienna Francis House, Salvation Army •	Workforce development opportunities through Heartland Workforce Solutions, AIM Institute</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The WCA will apply the LB1024 funds to direct programming costs for our Self-Sufficiency program – which includes staff/case management, supplies, and direct client assistance.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The WCA is a 501c3 with an operating board and finance committee that reviews the financial documents prepared by the Chief Financial Officer. After the initial investment from LB1024 is received, the WCA will use that funding as leverage with local corporate and foundation donors for other programs and wraparound services.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> The primary funding for this program is United Way of the Midlands. We have funds committed through June 30, 2024, but only a small portion of the expenses ($55,000/year).</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> The WCA’s Self-Sufficiency and Financial Security Program is scalable – with reduced funding we would have less staff and resources to serve the victims/survivors that need our services. The WCA would increase the collaboration with AIM Institute for Tech Bootcamp and provide additional supports to victims/survivors with this funding.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Currently the WCA receives $55,000 in funding that is not committed past June 30, 2024 for the program. The WCA utilizes our own operating and general funds to support the program, and will continue to do so as long as there is need.</p>
