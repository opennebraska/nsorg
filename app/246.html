  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Learning Community of Douglas and Sarpy Counties (LC) is an educational subdivision focused on outcomes and opportunities for children and families. In 2020, the LC delivered quality early childhood education and family engagement programs to 11 school districts and more than 16,000 children and adults. Although programs and school districts responded to mitigate the pandemic crisis, significant negative impacts on families’ lives remain to be addressed. 

Two Learning Community Centers currently operate in north and south Omaha. The Learning Community Strategic Plan calls for expansion through a Third center serving a geographic area in south central Omaha inclusive of Achievement Sub Councils 3, 4, and 6. This includes the Millard, Papillion La Vista, Ralston, and Westside school districts.  

The LC seeks to support 2 generation educational programming with Millard, Ralston, and Westside school districts. In partnership with the school districts, the LC looks to secure a physical location to provide expanded programming to support early childhood development and executive functioning, parenting classes, GED and ESL courses, and workforce development initiatives. The LC is currently in contract negotiations with the ownership group of a selected building and architectural designs are in place to provide needed facility rehabilitation. The LC seeks additional resources to secure the physical facility and provide programmatic offerings for approximately 150-200 additional family units.  

Initial projections suggest that facility completion will take 8-10 months. The LC will work to implement pilot programming in the expanded territory while planning to move into the new facility. To do so, the LC will require additional resources to staff a full roster of qualified professionals to administer theory-based, well researched programming and interact with families on a consistent and effective basis.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Currently, the Learning community is engaged in architectural design renderings, as well as negotiations with building ownership entities. Once approved, architectural designs will go out for bid and construction phases will begin shortly thereafter. Once construction and rehabilitation are complete, on-site programming will begin with pilot offerings. Our intention is to scale program participant numbers up in phases each year until we reach our proposed cap of 150-200 families.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Locating a Learning Community Center in South Central Omaha responds to results from community landscape assessments conducted over the past two years to identify stakeholders’ input on expanded programming. Proximity to the Millard, Ralston, and Westside school districts will position the Learning Community as a resource for communities whose poverty pockets have expanded according to the 2020 census data. Sustainable Community, Quality of Life and Policy needs are addressed by engaging families in academic support for early childhood students, language and education courses for caregivers, as well as workforce development training for caregivers. These programs will directly impact approximately 150-200 more families. Programs will meet the needs of families and children who are eager to participate and advance their academic and social status. 

In the Learning Community, closing the achievement gap means opening doors to opportunity for the whole family. Since 2000, the growth of poverty was three times greater for children and families in schools across the Learning Community than the total student population and significantly higher than the rest of Nebraska. The proven education strategies and initiatives described in this proposal include opportunities for family learning: English for parents, educational navigators, parent workshops, parent-child activities, and adult education – all aligning with Sustainable Community education priorities. Sustainability is also delivered as families gain self-sufficiency and independence, teachers are connected with professional development training, potential workers will be more skilled and apt to compete for and maintain livable wage careers, as well as invest in their neighborhood communities.  

Quality of life will be enhanced in proximity of the third Center, in part from neighborhood beautification and safety features. Community members will have access to quality of life resources that help improve health, mental health, and nutrition through community-based partners like UNO Special Education/Communication Disorders, UNO School of Music, Opera Omaha, PTI Nebraska, Joslyn Art Museum, ASCEND Network at Aspen Institute, Lutheran Family Service, Project Harmony, Heartland Workforce Solutions, The Big Garden, Douglas County Health Department, Food Bank of the Heartland, Latino Center of the Midlands, Omaha Public Library, Omaha Conservatory of Music, Buffett Early Childhood Institute, City Sprouts, Creighton University, Child Saving Institute, Nebraska Extension Office, Omaha Fire Department, Women's Center for Advancement, UNMC Center for Reducing Health Disparities, UNO Service Learning Academy, Metropolitan Community College, and Nebraska Early Childhood Collaborative. 

In addition, this proposal aligns with Policy to help create a more positive educational environment for students and families of color. The community has looked to the Learning Community for assistance in leading community conversation on educational training for teachers and early childhood best practices.  

The Learning Community is an established policy change-leader. The Learning Community and its partners work with the Omaha Chamber and business leaders to identify critical gaps in our local economy. Outcomes from these collaborations include internships, college prep sessions, apprenticeships, skills-based certifications and other innovations creating cradle to career pathways.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> According to the visioning workshop summary, residents described a need for resources to support education, quality of life, youth and adult employment, and sustainable communities. This proposal allows for furthering educational efforts and providing much needed upskilling for those seeking meaningful employment. As more families are engaged and equipped, they will realize enhancements in personal, academic and workforce circumstances. The Learning Community will offer courses for children related to executive functioning, reading comprehension, emotional stability, as well as problem solving skills. Courses for caregivers/parents include, but are not limited to: Parenting, financial well-being, emotional maturation, GED, ESL, and workforce development. Courses are consistently assessed and improved with each cohort of participants. Our data evaluation (conducted by the University of Nebraska’s Munroe Meyer Institute) shows consistent, significant impact in learning and improved circumstances in the lives of children and adults.  

Additionally, community members put forth a desire to have culturally relevant information disseminated on a consistent basis. Our educational courses are built with multiple identities in mind, and specifically address culturally relevant information in order to promote comprehension and direct action. This is readily evident with our ESL and GED courses, as well as culturally specific programming.  

Residents also stated that resources are not readily available for various family supports and programs. Many nonprofit, community-based organizations are not able to meet the demand for programming for those residing in certain neighborhoods. Providing resources to support these community needs will allow for additional families to be engaged and encouraged to receive desired programming. 

The Third Center would provide a new hub for partners (listed above in Needs Alignment) to meet, provide, and/or develop community resources appropriate to the neighborhood needs. Families can also rely on the Center to help them connect to partners providing quality food/produce, another weakness identified in the visioning workshops.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Third Center described in this proposal aligns with eligible services for LB1024 funds. The LC will use these funds to respond to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic, including support for early learning services and improvements/new construction for early learning facilities. With a service area of South Central Omaha, the proposal addresses the disparate impact of COVID-19 on the populations living in and/or adjacent to the disproportionately impacted communities in QCTs targeted by these funds. This proposal addresses educational disparities, as defined in the Final Rule (p. 8).  

COVID-19 limited in-person classes during a time when families needed more support than ever before. Staff were nimble and connected with parents and children together in virtual and outdoor classes until the gradual transition back to in-person learning. Teams in the Learning Community Centers worked with generous donors to equip families with technology and resolve internet access issues, but that wasn’t enough. Even with access to technology, the pandemic created an immediate need for digital literacy. Parents needed skills to not only to connect to fulfill basic needs, but also skills to act as tech support for their children’s digital activities. New parent classes were developed that cover everything from basic computer skills and keyboarding to email communications and zoom conferences with teachers. Demands of home-based virtual learning also drained family financial resources, as many wage earners left the workforce to be family caregivers. 

The 2-Gen programming promotes the success of families and children living in the neighborhoods of eleven OPS school communities. In 2020, the Learning Community’s programming impacted more than 16,000 children and adults, delivering transformational benefits like children being more likely to succeed in school, stronger and more independent families, and more schools embracing early childhood education. 

Fundamental Change may be best summarized by a parent that participated in the LCCSO programming: “I don’t need a translator anymore. I feel excited that I’m able to talk with the teachers.” 

An important part of the Learning Community mission is to help our community understand how a family’s financial security can connect to student proficiency. Nearly half the families in the metro area with school-age children experience challenges related to income and economic opportunity. Over 74% of adults in community center neighborhoods work and take classes. Families continue to face tremendous financial strain, with many continuing to work in places that don’t have the benefits that offer them protection from COVID-19. This proposal offers long-lasting Economic Growth through the combined offerings of English, GED and workforce training that give parents skills to support their children in school while building a stronger future for the entire family.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Learning Community Centers often engage businesses and providers for services to support 2-generation programming and family engagement. We pride ourselves on securing resources from within our neighborhood communities. Adding more workforce in the area Will likely increase local commerce, as well.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The vision of the Learning Community of Douglas and Sarpy Counties is that all children within the Learning Community will achieve academic success without regard to social or economic circumstances. Together with school districts and community organizations as partners, the Learning Community demonstrates, implements, and shares more effective practices to measurably improve educational outcomes for children and families in poverty. To achieve lasting impact, the existing Learning Community Centers provide family-focused, two generation programs intended to support families, parents, and guardians to ensure greater student success in school and beyond. These efforts significantly improve the local schools, neighborhoods, and community environments.  

The Learning Community’s research-based strategies deliver long-term economic gain by serving two generations: -- parent and child -- with programming based on the principles that: 1) students benefit from high-quality classrooms, 2) reflective coaching adds value to the classroom, 3) family engagement is critical for a child’s success in school, and 4) students’ early childhood outcomes predict later school success.  

Quality early childhood programs have been linked to immediate, positive developmental outcomes, as well as long-term, positive academic performance (Burchinal, et al., 2010; Barnett, 2008). Research shows that all children benefit from high-quality preschool, with low-income children and English learners benefiting the most Yoshiwaka, et al. (2013). High-quality classroom organization is related to fewer student behavior problems and increased social competence (Rimm-Karufman, 2009). This is especially important following post-COVID circumstances. 

Communities benefit from school readiness. Preparation to perform in an educational setting is a significant benefit for students, especially those who are from diverse backgrounds, with a greater number of risk factors. These students typically have poorer school performance compared to their economically advantaged counterparts (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000). Students enrolled earlier and for a longer duration demonstrate better short- and long-term results (Barnett, 2008). In studies of the longer-term effects of preschool programs, the importance of quality teaching in early elementary grades is also important. Research found that investments in elementary schools influence the strength of ongoing preschool effects, researchers have found that the level of challenge provided by kindergarten teachers matters for later outcomes (Johnson & Jackson, 2017).  

The Learning Community uses a two-generation approach in designing early childhood and family engagement programs at each of the centers, Learning Community Center of South Omaha and Parent University at Learning Community Center of North Omaha. This creates opportunities for and addresses the needs of both children and adults. Using the whole-family approach, programs focus equally and intentionally on children and parents.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The Third Center proposed will, like other Learning Community Center locations, become a vital resource for community sustainability. Anecdotal evidence of how Learning Community staff have helped community members during the pandemic crisis helps describe how resources improve quality of life. THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD. Families were impacted financially, socially, mentally, and health-wise. Preventative work was provided at the beginning of the pandemic (i.e., connecting families to food pantries or jobs). One participant noted, as some participants tested positive for COVID-19, staff connected families to testing locations and financial supports (i.e., Together Inc., public schools, Project Harmony, and Heartland Family Service). Families experienced significant emotional stress. During the early months and summer of 2020, families were expressing worry and fears. The staff assisted families with coping strategies to navigate through those emotions. Growing Great Kids/Growing Great Families curriculum provided strategies to support children and families experiencing stress. The program transitioned from providing support with routines and nutrition to mental health services. A presentation on grieving during COVID-19 was provided for families. The presentation focused on behaviors associated during this period (i.e., side effects of not being at school and changes in their normal routines). 

The teaching team for LCCSO continued to engage with participants and families in a multitude of ways. They created a YouTube channel to keep families engaged, provided information on Facebook, assisted with educational supports and videos to assist with remote learning packets from OPS, provided ESL classes and home visits online, and delivered curriculum classes through Zoom. Teaching participants moved from classroom teaching expanding into virtual classes and tutoring. For many participants, the teaching team needed to provide training and teaching on the use of technology. Several families did not have their own tablet or computer at home and were unfamiliar with how to use basic functions including email, website navigation and connection with school resources. As a result, the team began providing classes on computer literacy. 

Similarly, the Third Center will be responsive resource centers to each neighborhood’s unique culture, community needs, and educational vitality. Community forums and client assessments will help identify potential customized and equitable programming for Learning Community families that reflect academic, social, emotional and community success.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Learning Community continues to pride itself on remaining current and inclusive of all best practices in early childhood education and family engagement. Being recognized by the Aspen Institute ASCEND Network as a top tier program provider in the state of Nebraska displays the level of attention and dedication toward providing the best possible educational setting for families. The Center also earned the White House honor as Bright Spot in Hispanic education in 2015 for its 2- generation programming efforts and outcomes.    Regular landscape and literature research guides the continuous improvement model of the Learning Community programs.       One example is the implementation of a two-generation partnership with parents and children. This model offers pathways for parents to develop skills that support relationships and student success, including protective factors that support health and well-being that are especially important when families are facing challenges. In addition to actively supporting their children in education, two-generation programs give parents an opportunity build workforce-ready skills. With support from educational navigators, parents make choices based on the needs of their families. Research shows workforce training improves family outcomes for two generations. Typically, children do better in school when families build a more secure future. LCCSO is seeing outstanding results. More than 60% of the parents in ESL classes reached Level 4 of 6 skill levels in Reading and Listening, representing an ability to understand everyday conversation, participate in routine interactions, and recognize phrases to follow simple directions. More than 60% of LCCSO parents in GED classes increased their skills by 3-4 grade levels, putting them on a path to qualify for career training programs or pursue a college degree. Nearly 300 workforce certifications have been earned by LCCSO parents, giving them tangible proof of skills to enter the workforce or secure a higher-wage job.      The theory of change behind the 2Gen approach suggests aligning services for parents and children yields stronger and lasting results (ASCEND, 2018). Based on community needs, each Learning Community Center developed a comprehensive program to address the opportunity gap for children and families based on the unique characteristics of each community and their needs. Key elements of the 2Gen approach include:    *Early Childhood Development    *Health & Well-being    *Post-secondary & Employment Pathways    *Economic Assets    *Social Capital</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Nine consecutive years of rigorous independent evaluations have shown positive program impact and results. Parents have been highly satisfied with all components of the program and have shown increases in their levels of comfort in engaging their children with reading and math as well as communicating with their child's teacher and the school. Parents who spoke English as a Second Language improved in their ability and comfort level when talking to English speakers. Students whose parents were in programming attended school regularly, with 88% meeting the district's 95% attendance goal. While COVID-19 has interrupted state testing, in the past and for several years running, students of the parents who participated in programming at the Learning Community Center of South Omaha exceeded district average proficiency rates, approaching state average rates.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The University of Nebraska’s Munroe Meyer Institute conducts annual independent evaluations of all Learning Community Center of Douglas and Sarpy Counties programs, which are formative in nature to ensure continuous improvement. An extensive data evaluation report is presented to the Coordinating Council each year, as well as submitted to the Nebraska Department of Education and submitted to the Nebraska Legislature.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Legislatively, the Elementary Learning Centers are funded by the property tax levy across two Nebraska counties - Douglas and Sarpy.  To adequately cover the cost of staff and benefits, building materials, operations expenses, and other various items, the rationale for this total dollar amount is illustrated in the budget documentation. Additional grant awards and philanthropic support will be necessary to support operations moving forward.  

The attached budget reflects rental and rehabilitation numbers for a property rather than purchase. As a political subdivision, the Learning Community Center for Douglas and Sarpy Counties cannot own property.  

Please note that preliminary architecture/engineering estimates are based on preliminary figures from RDG, which serve as a cost example until formal bidding process opens.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> This grant award will support the capital development and operations of the Learning Community Center of 3rd Center location. Necessary additions and rehabilitation of an existing building, as well as acquiring a qualified workforce will be vital to the Center’s success.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Yes, if awarded this funding, the satellite location will remain fiscally sustainable for years to come. The Learning Community remains very diligent about allotting taxpayer dollars toward community impact initiatives.  The Learning Community Coordinating Council regularly discusses financial operations for the entire organization. A yearly budget is created and approved on an annual basis. A budget, finance and accounting subcommittee meets monthly to discuss financial operations with the Learning Community Finance Director and CEO. Lastly, an exhaustive audit process conducted by the state of Nebraska occurs each year.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> The Learning Community receives funding from the State of Nebraska Governor's budget, as well as a levy connected to County property taxes. Additional funds could be raised by a newly formed foundation that specifically supports the Learning Community.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> TBD</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Yes, the State of Nebraska Governor's line-item allotment, as well as a levy amount connected to County property taxes.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> No, this project at this location is not scalable. Each location may be broken down into specific components, which could be completed in separate phases.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> The program is scalable to include Centers throughout the Subcouncils’ service areas. A separate proposal represents another level of scalability, by requesting funds for a satellite location, rather than a full Center, as this proposal represents. As seen in the overall budget, there will be consideration for interior, exterior, landscaping, and structural rehabilitation within this project.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The Learning Community remains consistently committed to utilizing its resources to positively impact families in the learning community. This was the original intent of the Learning Community and remains the same today. The Learning Community is fully committed to funding these facilities and programs as far as our local levy and state funding allow. This grant will free tax dollars to expand services to more children and families for a longer period. This grant award will also extend sustainability of programming and enable more Centers to be opened that will serve more families as poverty has extended further west in the greater Omaha community. We will also be seeking private funding to support these efforts at our Centers. 

The Learning Community has been diligently managing funds in the recent past to position ourselves to make an investment in a new Center. We are poised to remain financially vigilant with taxpayer funds.</p>
