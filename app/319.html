  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> I have completed fulfilled requests for clean outs/trash outs of homes for property owners, several of them with properties in North Omaha. My efforts alleviate the stress of a property owner needing to do the sometimes grueling physical work themselves. I also provide yard waste/debris removal which also helps to keep properties safe. Organizations have hired me to remove items that have been illegally dumped onto their property. One organization's president contacted me to remove debris that was illegally dumped; the president of the told me she was so thankful for my services, because they had visitors coming later in the day.

I have cleaned out a property for a realtor who was otherwise ready to close, but needed the items out to proceed.

I've also removed unwanted items within homes and fallen branches, small trees, and overgrown shrubs for a local property management company.</p>
