  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The MDBMSC Development Plan encompasses a capital project of developing the building at 2216 N 24th Street into a museum focused on the black newspaper and the life of pioneer publisher Mildred Brown, thus creating a visitor attraction that will also be a source for economic revenue, create jobs, and contribute to the traffic flow in the area.  The MDBMSC Development Plan has a purpose to create jobs within the organization to expand the organization and align with the goals of the strategic plan to develop a self-sustaining organization that has growth potential into the future in all programs and with the facility that we occupy. The building at 2216 N 24th St is on the historic register, which gives it significance and speaks to the value of maintaining this site and developing it as tourist attraction.  This proposal supports the programs of MDBMSC that will provide funding for the operations of the business to expand staff to professional jobs in the census tract.  Because the organization has profit centers (printing and the newspaper), the monies that will create sustainable jobs that will be sustainable by profits created in the businesses.

Jobs will be created and staffed on a quarterly basis until all positions are filled by Q3 2024.
