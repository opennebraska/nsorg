  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> MLCDC helps historically underrepresented, low-income individuals such as Latinos and refugees achieve financial stability through entrepreneurship. Our programs lower entry barriers to entrepreneurship, such as language barriers, access to capital, networking, and access to technical assistance. We accomplish this through a unique cultural approach that allows us to better understand, develop, and maintain connections with the communities of color that MLCDC serves in Lincoln, Omaha, and Council Bluffs. Recent accomplishments related to our mission include:   

1. Reorganizing programming and taking steps to position the organization for long-term success. In the past two years, MLCDC’s board and executive leadership has refined internal processes, contracted for accounting services with Nonprofit Association of the Midlands, developed a 3-year strategic plan, and contracted with a reputable fundraising firm to pursue grant funding. These steps will ensure we can respond to increased demand for services by Latino and refugee residents while being backed by sound internal and fiscal practices, with a plan going forward for strategic, sustainable growth.  


2. Growing programs despite the challenges of the pandemic and its economic aftermath. Last year, MLCDC served 230 individuals in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa. We provided financial education training for 120 people, business plan training to 70, created 20 LLCs, created 40 new jobs, retained 20 jobs, and provided technical assistance to 52 small businesses in Spanish. Our new approach to the entrepreneurship program (implemented May 2020) has already prepared more than 100 participants to be successful through financial education and business training.  

3. Providing financial education to an underserved population in Omaha: Latina women with children. Most participants in our Financial Stability program (90%) are working women with part-time or temporary seasonal jobs. They seek ways to take control of their financial future and to better provide for their families. Most are first- or second-generation immigrants, and their top goal after achieving financial stability is to build wealth so their children can access college and other opportunities to attain a higher quality of life. We are the only organization in Omaha that serves this population’s need for financial education in their primary language.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> MLCDC seeks funding to renovate two facilities on 24th Street in South Omaha to expand its programming to Latinx residents. These sites will be used to deliver MLCDC’s Financial Stability program, Accelerator Entrepreneurship program, and childcare certification in Spanish to approximately 378 individuals over the next three years.   

Renovations—MLCDC will renovate a 2,000-square-foot space at 2401 N. Street to expand onsite and remote delivery of classes for its Financial Stability and Accelerator Entrepreneurship programs. MLCDC also seeks funding to renovate its existing 2,200-square-foot headquarters to transform this space into a dedicated childcare training center. At this location, MLCDC will prepare and certify childcare workers to deliver culturally affirming care to Latino children. Renovations will take place by December 31, 2023 and programming will be delivered from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project will address several community needs for South Omaha. A primary emphasis on programming will be helping Latinx families become financially self-sufficient, grow assets, and increase generational wealth through entrepreneurship. At the same time, MLCDC’s childcare training program will develop a culturally responsive, highly qualified workforce for the community.  

The number of Latinx living in poverty in Nebraska, and more specifically, the Omaha-metro area, has risen steadily over the past decade. According to the most recent U.S. Census, 27.6% of Latinos in Omaha and 27.8 % statewide live in poverty, compared to 16.9% and 20.4% in 2000, respectively. At the same time, 60% of Hispanic Nebraskans experienced an adverse employment impact during the pandemic, according to a late 2021 survey published by the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Many of these populations were laid off or had their hours reduced, forcing families to go into debt to survive. While Nebraska has mostly exited the pandemic, these families must now contend with rising inflation that has increased expenses for housing, vehicles, and other basic needs without a corresponding increase in wages. In many cases, the economic downturn has significantly reduced or even eliminated people’s personal savings.  

While several programs in Omaha help residents manage their finances or become entrepreneurs, MLCDC is the only organization that uses a culturally fluent approach to financial education and business training. We offer courses in participants’ own language, taught by instructors who shared their lived experiences and understand their culture. Cultural fluency goes beyond simply delivering the program in Spanish; it means understanding how participants’ culture and values impact their financial habits and decision-making and then coaching them to make decisions that best serve their long-term goals. Our Financial Stability is designed to lay a strong foundation of personal finances before an individual trains as a small business owner through the Accelerator Entrepreneurship program. The childcare certification program is part of MLCDC’s entrepreneurship/workforce development training and also aids Latinx families by providing culturally responsive childcare for the community and qualifying childcare workers for a higher wage.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> An identified need for South Omaha from the Visioning Workshop was that the area needs additional training opportunities and childcare. MLCDC provides training primarily to Hispanic women, a population that historically has not had access to culturally fluent financial education and business training. We offer courses in Spanish, taught by immigrant instructors. This makes participants comfortable to fully participate in the process. Cultural fluency goes beyond simply delivering the program in Spanish, however; it means understanding how participants’ culture impacts their financial habits and decision-making. MLCDC’s program is effective because our instructors understand and address these dynamics.   

MLCDC’s programs address many barriers Latinas face trying to obtain training from more traditional sources. This includes language barriers, lack of transportation, lack of childcare, and lower education levels. Our classes and mentoring take place in person and via a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. This is important because Black and Hispanic Americans are less likely to own a computer than White residents (Black: 69%; Hispanic: 67%; White: 80%), according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey. Black and Hispanic individuals also are less likely to have high-speed internet at home. For Hispanics in particular, mobile devices play a larger role in accessing the internet than it does for their Black or White peers--a full quarter of Hispanics are “smartphone-only” internet users. By delivering programming via diverse technological platforms, MLCDC eliminates another barrier for Latinx to receive financial education. 

Through its childcare certification program, MLCDC provides the community with quality, culturally responsive childcare while preparing providers to command a higher wage. Research shows that children need quality care to develop, yet daycares have increasingly struggled to retain qualified employees. The pandemic exacerbated this problem, as facilities reduced services or closed due to staffing shortages. Within Omaha, there is a shortage of childcare services and jobs that pay a living wage. MLCDC’s childcare worker certification in Spanish addresses the need for trained providers who can offer culturally affirming care for these children—a rarity outside of private, in-home daycares. The certification also helps participants demonstrate competency so they can command a higher wage as workers.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> MLCDC’s programming primarily serves low-income Hispanic women who live in Qualified Census Tracts in South Omaha. This population, which relies primarily on low-paying hourly jobs, suffered severe economic losses as a result of the pandemic and has struggled to recover in the wake of rising inflation. By equipping Latinx families to become financially stable through our Financial Stability program, we prepare them to become successful small business owners. Our childcare certification program also aids economic recovery by training more providers for the community and helping these individuals to command a higher wage.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> While MLCDC offers its Financial Stability programming to individuals who are interested in the Accelerator Entrepreneurship program, we also support individuals who are existing small business owners by helping them gain a handle on cash flow, taxes, bookkeeping, etc. We provide monthly opportunities to network with other small business owners so Hispanic entrepreneurs in South Omaha can develop lucrative partnerships. Finally, MLCDC provides microloans of up to $50,000 to qualifying small business owners to purchase equipment or supplies to expand their business over time.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Starting and running a small business has the potential to lift Latino families out of poverty, improve their quality of life dramatically, and pave the way for their children to achieve personal and professional success as adults. Yet these families are significantly less likely than other groups to be entrepreneurs. In Omaha, for example, just 4.6% of all local businesses are owned by Hispanics. While 41% of those are women-owned, Latinas face additional barriers to entrepreneurship that their male counterparts do not. Hispanic women tend to have lower English proficiency, lower education levels, less robust work histories, and greater family responsibilities, all of which can make it more difficult for them to access expert business training, start a business, access capital, and grow the business over time, according to a 2014 report by the University of Nebraska Omaha titled, “Hispanic Entrepreneurship in Nebraska: Trends and Economic Profile.”   

MLCDC’s expansion of services will provide nearly 218 Latinx families with the opportunity to become financially stable, build assets, and start their own small business. Long-term, these families will be better positioned to build generational wealth and break the cycle of poverty. This project also will diversify the economy by increasing the number of Hispanic childcare providers and small business owners in the Omaha metro area.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal contributes to the community’s stability by helping low-income Hispanic families become financially stable, then providing opportunities for those families to become successful entrepreneurs. MLCDC’s childcare certification expands the childcare workforce in South Omaha, increases the stability and quality of this workforce, and provides culturally responsive childcare for the Latino community.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> MLCDC follows evidence-based program models and best practices by ensuring culturally appropriate program delivery. We gain participants’ trust and demonstrate credibility by using instructors and business coaches from similar backgrounds to participants who also speak their first language. This is in line with research showing that the most consistent success is seen in organizations that offer services that are culturally appropriate by individuals with similar lived experiences. Furthermore, MLCDC’s curriculums are community informed. Our courses were designed by an entrepreneur with lived experience as an immigrant and integrates content from different areas of expertise regarding business development and entrepreneurship. It is an improved model similar to other programs such as the Microbusiness & Asset Development Program (offered through Catholic Charities) but also incorporates participant feedback, new research, and best practices as they become available. No other organization in Omaha offers MLCDC’s culturally fluent approach to financial education and business training. Our childcare certification similarly prepares participants to deliver culturally affirming care, which research has shown it critical to children’s proper development.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> As part of program evaluation, MLCDC measures:  1. Number of participants attending training courses (Financial Education, Entrepreneurship, and Childcare) ; 2. Number of small businesses assisted; 3. Number of new businesses opened; 4. Number of workshops and training events provided; 5. Number of individual coaching sessions with small businesses; 6. Number of jobs created; 7. Number of jobs retained. Long-term, MLCDC expects that at least 80% of the small businesses led and owned by Latinx who complete the Accelerator Entrepreneurship Program will report a profit tracked by their tax returns (Schedule C). MLCDC’s history of impact shows that participants improve their financial situation by 10% minimum in the first year after completing the program.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> MLCDC staff measure these outcomes for program participants through pre- and post-surveys conducted at six months and one-year past program completion.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, this program acts as a catalyst for co-investment/secondary investment. Individuals who complete MLCDC’s Accelerator Entrepreneurship program often need help obtaining access to capital. This population tends to have less credit history, lower credit scores, and little if any collateral that qualifies them for business loans. MLCDC currently has a small microlending program that augments its entrepreneurship training, but we are limited in the number of people we can help due to limited resources. A secondary investment that expands our lending program would enable us to service Hispanic small business owners who often need help navigating the complex world of banking and loans, and provide them with the extra capital they need to expand their businesses.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> MLCDC will use funding for renovations and programming at two addresses in South Omaha: 

Childcare Training Center--4923 South 24th Street, Suite 201, Omaha (2,200 sq ft). This will be renovated to include a hands-on childcare laboratory, classroom space, remote class delivery space, and administrative offices. Funds will cover the expense of renovations, furnishings, and rent.  

Training Facility for Financial Stability and Accelerator Entrepreneurship programs—2401 N. Street, Omaha (2,000 sq ft). This space will be renovated to include classrooms for course delivery as well as one-on-one coaching in personal finance and business training. Funds will cover the expense of renovations, furnishings, and rent.  

MLCDC also will use funding to conduct three programs for Latinx residents over the next three years. This funding will support: 

Financial Stability Program: The hiring of 1 FTE instructor and 1 FTE program coordinator; program delivery for 218 individuals.   

Accelerator Entrepreneurship Program: The hiring of 1 FTE business consultant and 1 FTE program coordinator; business training for 60 individuals; support for 20 business owners.   

Childcare Certification Program: The hiring of 1 FTE program director; program delivery for 100 individuals.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> This proposal will help MLCDC create adequate training space for its financial stability and entrepreneurship programming, as well as its childcare certification program. For the past 10 years, MLCDC has rented a 2,200-square foot space in South Omaha that is inadequate for the number of people it currently trains, nor is it at all adequate for the number of people who have requested and need our services. Our main instructional space is a single multipurpose room that must be constantly reconfigured to accommodate our varied schedule of online and in-person classes, as well as business coaching. Sometimes, we must change out the space twice a day, which consumes significant staff time. Our offices/classroom space is on the second floor, does not have handicapped access, and does not have room for onsite childcare services. Most of MLCDC’s participants are women, many of whom have younger children. These funds would help us renovate handicapped-accessible space that has room for instruction, individual coaching, and onsite childcare.  

This funding also would help MLCDC’s build capacity to serve approximately 20% more individuals. Our current funding level only enables the organization to provide financial education for 120 individuals per year, and business training and mentoring to 100 individuals per year. However, these numbers represent only a small portion of the immigrants and refugees who need our services. In the past two years, we have received nearly 450 applications for services, but we simply do not have the resources (staffing or funding to hire staff) to meet this request. Nebraska is undergoing significant demographic changes right now, and it is predicted that the number of Latinx alone will triple in the next 10 years. MLCDC has a highly effective model that makes financial stability accessible to these populations, but we will need more funding to meet the community’s need for culturally fluent financial education, business training, and workforce development in the childcare arena.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> MLCDC is a nonprofit that relies on private donations, fundraising events, and private foundation support to operate. This model has supported and grown our programming since inception and will continue to support programming beyond the grant period.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> In the past three years, MLCDC has taken steps toward long-term stability and success. We have now developed relationships with large private foundations such as the Marion Ewing Kauffman Foundation, Sherwood Foundation, and Peter Kiewit Foundation. We also created a 3-year strategic plan with the help of Parlay Consulting Review and contracted with Fox Creek Fundraising to meet our annual fundraising goals. In 2022, we have submitted more than $500,000 in funding requests to support our programming; we have received nearly $400,000, with additional funds still pending. We will sustain this programming in the future by continuing to pursue private donations and funding from private, corporate, and government sources.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> MLCDC has two pending requests for its Financial Stability program: $50,000 pending from the Weitz Family Foundation and $15,000 from the Semerad Foundation. We also just received $10,000 from the Mutual of Omaha Foundation for the Accelerator Entrepreneurship program. If received, pending funds will support 2023 programming.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> MLCDC calculates a per-participant cost for each of its programs. If less funding than requested is received, we will only serve the number of individuals that available funding permits.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> MLCDC has an annual operating budget of approximately $650,000. We commit to raising this amount to cover all administrative costs through our regular fundraising channels. We have already secured $25,000 from the Fund for Omaha for 2023 expenses for the childcare certification program. We will commit pending funds from the Weitz Family Foundation, and Semerad Foundation to programs if these funds are awarded for 2023.</p>
