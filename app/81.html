  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> Together is a nonprofit organization focused on creating a community of prosperity where everyone experiences safe, affordable housing, food security, health, and wellness. Together administers five programs, supported by an administration and development team, to carry out our mission of preventing and ending homelessness in the Omaha metro area. These programs operate out of four facilities in the community, with our main campus located at 24th Street and Leavenworth.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The pandemic and its long-term recovery provided Together the opportunity to highlight its capacity and demonstrated our ability to step up when our community needed us most. For example, Together purchased and renovated the former 402 Hotel to establish a short-term emergency housing program for individuals aged sixty-five and older who have medical vulnerabilities and are experiencing homelessness. We were chosen as one of the contractors designated to distribute tens of millions of dollars of Emergency Rental Assistance funds, helping thousands of Omaha area households avoid eviction. To accommodate significantly expanded operations, we purchased the former 11worth Café to supplement our main office and pantry space and opened a second pantry in Council Bluffs. Overall, these highlights from the list of our completed projects over the past three years showcase our major accomplishment: quickly and responsively adapting our services to meet the needs of our community. Throughout its history, and especially during the pandemic and its aftermath, Together has demonstrated its ability to work collaboratively with both public and private partners and its capacity to effectively execute major projects on time and on budget.</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> This project presents a cohesive plan to transform the Columbus Park area, counteract the effects of systemic barriers stemming from past inequitable practices, and address social and economic challenges brought about by the pandemic. While practices such as redlining and the height of the COVID-19 crisis are behind us, negative effects continue to reverberate for individuals and families, exacerbated further by the city’s critical shortage of safe, affordable housing. To address these issues, we propose this redevelopment plan, integrating five partner organizations, four Qualified Census Tracts (19, 33, 39, 40), and four primary components. 
Together proposes major construction to expand its food pantry and improve its main offices. Over the last three years, Together has dramatically increased programs, services, and staff to help address food and housing insecurity, and Together’s current facility is simply inadequate to accommodate the new normal. This project will right-size Together’s facility, ensuring the organization is well-poised to meet the needs of the Omaha community members facing hunger and homelessness.  
The Columbus Park Neighborhood Association proposes several enhancements within the neighborhood, Leavenworth business district, and surrounding area. Proposed aesthetic and functional projects include creation of a new garden recreation space, façade improvement for area businesses, and other enhancements.  
Heartland B-Cycle proposes the installation of an e-bike docking station. The bikeshare station will be an asset to the community—enhancing transportation opportunities and improving neighborhood connectivity and benefiting area businesses, workers, and the community in general.  
RMD Real Estate Group and JDP Holdings propose construction of quality affordable housing. This timely intervention in Omaha’s affordable housing crisis will help reduce the precarity of low-income residents who would otherwise face a heightened risk of eviction, homelessness, and other collateral consequences of being housing-cost burdened.  
A small investment can reap huge rewards, and we believe that this project will have a transformative effect on the community. By embracing the strengths and opportunities presented within our South Omaha neighborhood, we can make sustainable improvements to areas of weakness, empowering our community to thrive and withstand challenges to come.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our ARPA proposal encompasses the Leavenworth business district and the Columbus Park neighborhood and includes four major focal points: facility development, neighborhood improvement, transportation, and affordable housing.  </p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project aligns with findings from the South Omaha Visioning Workshops and makes a meaningful contribution to the goals identified by community stakeholders during the sessions.   

  

South Omaha SWOT Analysis   

Strengths: South Omaha’s culture; strong small business community; and success in positioning the 24th Street commercial district as an economic destination  

South Omaha’s strengths provide the foundation upon which this proposed project builds. The project will capitalize on and contribute to the community’s existing assets by continuing the development of the Columbus Park neighborhood and Leavenworth business district located along and near 24th Street. By improving utility, functionality, aesthetics, and safety, this project reinforces the community’s existing strengths.   

  

Opportunities: build on existing vibrancy and demand; leverage the diversity of culture and talent  

 Opportunities highlighted by workshop participants are a natural extension of the above-described strengths. This project embraces the opportunity to leverage those strengths to expand cultural and economic advantages in the community. Functionality, appearance, safety, and accessibility are all important to a successful business (or business district) or a sustainable community. This project addresses each of those crucial components and seizes the opportunities presented by the existing vibrancy, demand, diversity, and talent.  

  

Weaknesses: Older and singular-type housing stock; insufficient broadband, transit, and public infrastructure; lack of access to quality food  

Threats: limited land for growth; negative external perceptions  

Addressing infrastructure, livability, safety, and attractiveness as described above also aligns with the weaknesses and threats established at the visioning workshops. Fixing sidewalks and facades, adding lighting, rehabilitating blighted property, adding affordable housing, and adding transportation options all help improve infrastructure, increase access to quality food, and counter negative perceptions of the area.   

  

South Omaha Needs  

Workshop participants identified several foundational things that must happen for real transformational change to occur. This project would contribute to many of the needs identified, including housing, senior housing, food, health, recreation, walkability, connectivity, and gardens.   

  

Overarching Themes of Public Engagement Feedback  

The Public Engagement Summary points to three reoccurring themes that emerged from the workshop sessions: insufficient infrastructure, culturally contextualized development, and the ability to leverage community resources. As described above in the Strengths and Opportunities section, this project directly addresses the infrastructure problems within the community through physical improvements and increased transportation access. This proposal is a collaborative effort, and the scope of development was determined with input from residential neighbors and area businesses, thus reflecting the cultural context of the community. Finally, this proposal provides increased access and tools to leverage community resources by building out and better equipping Together’s organizational capacity, thereby enabling the organization to assist community members access the resources they need to find long-term stability and success. In short, this project would improve and increase access to Together—a community resource in and of itself. </p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024, enacted to address the “widespread economic, social, and public health-related turmoil that deepened existing disparities,” prioritized “social and economic challenges caused and exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health emergency including high unemployment, wage decreases, and food insecurity.” In particular, the legislation was focused on low-income and minority communities where the pandemic had a disproportionate impact, in part because of entrenched systemic inequalities stemming from past practices such as redlining. The statute emphasizes housing needs, assistance for small businesses, job training, and business development within communities and neighborhoods in Omaha’s Qualified Census Tracts.  

All four proposed project components are located in Qualified Census Tracts (19, 33, 39, 40) and align with the priorities articulated in LB1024.  

 

Facility Development  

Strategic Alignment: high unemployment, wage decreases, food insecurity, housing needs 

Qualified Census Tract: 39 

Improvement and expansion of Together’s facility will allow the organization to better serve the needs of those low-income and minority communities who face systemic barriers stemming from past inequitable practices such as redlining and who were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. This project will increase capacity, allowing expanded services for a greater number of community members. Services provided in pursuit of Together’s core mission of ending homelessness and hunger include: Crisis Engagement, which assists low-income households to resolve crises that would otherwise lead to a loss of housing; the Nourish Program, which increases food access through an on-site Choice Food Pantry (where community members pick their own food, just like a grocery store); and the Rapid Rehousing Program, which focuses on rehousing individuals and families who have been living on the streets, in vehicles, or at emergency shelters.  

 

Neighborhood Improvement 

Strategic Alignment: assistance for small businesses, business development 

Qualified Census Tracts: 19, 33, 39, 40 

The aesthetic and functional improvements proposed will increase the appeal of the Columbus Park neighborhood and the Leavenworth business district. Transformational elements include: revamping business facades on both sides of Leavenworth from I-480 to 24th Street and both sides of 24th Street from Leavenworth to Poppleton Street; elevating and expanding the garden and walking path on the southeast corner of 24th and Leavenworth; and incorporating solar-powered lighting to increase visibility and safety. These projects will enhance the curb appeal and walkability of the area, which, in conjunction with the other elements of the proposed project, will foster economic activity, provide a foundation for potential financial investment, and create economic vitality in the area.  

 

Transportation 

Strategic Alignment: high unemployment, wage decreases, food insecurity, housing needs, assistance for small businesses, business development 

Qualified Census Tract: 39 

This project proposes a Heartland B-Cycle e-bike station, which builds on the existing and planned transportation options (including existing bike lanes) along the 24th Street corridor and beyond and increases connectivity and access for those without a personal vehicle. E-bikes made available at the bikeshare station, utilized independently of or in conjunction with traditional public transportation, expand transportation options and increase connectivity. This benefits community members, who can utilize e-bikes to feasibly access employment opportunities in areas that otherwise may be inaccessible. This also benefits the Leavenworth business district since customers will enjoy easier access to area businesses. Furthermore, more transportation options will make it easier for low-income members of the Omaha community facing food and housing insecurity to get to Together’s facilities.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Project partners anticipate that 170 temporary jobs will be created and estimate total wages will be approximately $6.8 million annually during project implementation. Additionally, partners anticipate that the project will create fifty-six permanent jobs with wages totaling approximately $2.1 million annually. </p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Together instructed our owner’s representative and project manager to select a general contractor who prioritizes small and emerging business partners from within qualified census tracts and has a proven track record of delivering on this expectation. We selected a general contractor who documents their process for identifying, selecting, and promoting small and emerging business partners. Together will monitor and ensure compliance with this expectation.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Neighborhood Profile 

According to Neighborhood Scout, Columbus Park residents are ethnically diverse, with over half commonly identifying their ethnicity or ancestry as Mexican, about fifty percent of households indicating that they most commonly spoke Spanish, and about one third of residents stating that they were born in another country.  

A mixture of owners and renters occupy medium to small single-family homes or small apartment buildings. Much of the housing stock in the neighborhood is quite old, with many homes built before 1939 among a few constructed between 1940 and 1969. Neighborhood Scout highlights the notable and unique real estate, stating that the concentration of historic homes in the Columbus Park neighborhood is greater than that in ninety-nine percent of all neighborhoods in the United States. (Neighborhood Scout is a website providing neighborhood-level profiles based on algorithmic analysis of raw data and statistics collected from a variety of sources, including government agencies such as the Census Bureau). 

 

As a Qualified Census Tract, the Columbus Park area is one in which at least fifty percent of households have an income less than sixty percent of the Area Median Gross Income (26 U.S.C. 42(d)(5)(c)). For the Omaha metro area, this translates to about $50,000 gross income for a family of four (Department of Housing and Urban Development). According to Neighborhood Scout, the low-income neighbors in Columbus Park live in one of the lowest income neighborhoods in America (stating that the neighborhood income is lower than the income in ninety-one percent of neighborhoods in the United States). Neighborhood Scout also indicates that twenty-two percent of children residing in Columbus Park live below the federal poverty line, making the neighborhood poverty rate higher than seventy percent of all other U.S. neighborhoods. 

 

Community Benefit: 

The Columbus Park Improvement Project will create both direct and indirect benefits for the community. While the Columbus Park neighborhood features many historic homes, vibrant and diverse residents, and a strong neighborhood association, it is in serious need of reinvestment. With the mission to support and connect neighbors to build a thriving community, the Columbus Park Neighborhood Association has played a critical part in ensuring that this proposed plan reflects the actual wants and needs of the people who call this community home. Thus, each component of this project creates transformational change through both direct and diffused reinvestment in the area, improving the quality of life and sustainability in the Columbus Park neighborhood. 

The direct benefits are clear. This project will directly increase the livability of the community by adding natural recreational space, making the area more walkable, and enhancing the appearance overall. Increased transportation connects the community with the rest of the city, allowing more of those residents to participate in our economy. For those outside the area, additional transportation options will provide easier access to Columbus Park-area businesses and increase the desirability of the neighborhood. Affordable housing options contribute to community sustainability, both from an economic and a quality-of-life perspective. Expansion of the Together facility will directly benefit those experiencing or at risk of housing and food insecurity.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The project will also create more indirect benefits. Neighborhood beautification and enhanced usability will change perceptions of Columbus Park—both within the neighborhood itself and of the greater community. In turn, this change in perception creates the framework for economic growth and sustainability in neighborhood improvements and new housing investments. The success of revitalization projects in Omaha’s other older areas demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted expenditures to improve neighborhood functionality and aesthetics. Good examples of this phenomenon include the burgeoning neighborhoods of Dundee, Benson, and Little Italy. In the same way, this project will make functional and aesthetic investments that strengthen existing ties within a vibrant and diverse community. Further, stabilization of the Columbus Park neighborhood will have enormous long-term benefits, drawing new business and economic stability, solidifying community sustainability, and promoting safety. Combined, the facility development, neighborhood improvement, increased transportation, and new affordable housing units will anchor the micro-economic hub developing along the 24th Street corridor.  

Finally, expanding the Together campus will directly benefit the entire City of Omaha by providing food, services, and support to some of our most vulnerable community neighbors.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Columbus Park Neighborhood Improvement Project leverages best practices and innovation by bringing non-profit and for-profit entities together to lift-up a community that is disproportionately affected by poverty and lack of opportunity. Together along with Heartland B-Cycle are established non-profits that operate from a data-informed approach and provide services based on established service delivery models with consistently positive outcomes.    Additionally, working with housing developers, investors, neighborhood associations, non-profits, and local businesses in a collaborative effort to change the Columbus Park neighborhood is an innovative approach that requires creativity, flexibility, and a common goal of working for the community.   This project demonstrates best practices and innovation by focusing on and implementing strategies to highlight our core values of Hope, Dignity, Compassion, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Number of businesses that improved their facades   Linear feet of pedestrian walkway improved/created   Number of riders utilizing new bike share transportation   Number of affordable housing units created   Number of households supported with food and housing annually</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> These outcomes would be measured through a tracking system (NetSuite) implemented by Together and carried out and maintained by the project partners.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> In short, yes. This project will invest funds into affordable housing, neighborhood beautification, transportation, safety, and small businesses all to bring more economic impact to the Columbus Park neighborhood and surrounding area. With this investment, we envision a neighborhood that is transformed to be safer, more attractive, and more economically sound, bringing consumers and businesses alike to Columbus Park to invest and create jobs. Additionally, according to Dr. Eric Thompson, chair of the College of Economics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and director of the Bureau of Business Research, our $38 million project would be a catalyst for $76 million in economic activity in the area. The multiplier is at least one to one – for every new dollar of new investment in construction, an additional dollar is created as the money courses through the economy.</p>

  <h3>DisplacementExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> The Columbus Park Neighborhood Improvement Project will work to transform an area that runs from 28th street on the West to 24th street on East and Jones Street on the North to Poppleton on the South. More specifically, this project will focus on transforming the southwest corner of 24th and Leavenworth with a new campus for Together that will provide food and housing services for the community.  

The façade improvement program will largely focus on improving businesses along Leavenworth from 28th to 24th Street, creating a new feel to the corridor when exiting I-480 and heading south on Leavenworth toward downtown Omaha.  

The project will focus on rehabilitating the Flora Apartments at 25th and Jones and raising new affordable housing on the northeast corner of 24th and Leavenworth.  

The project will focus on a green space on east 24th Street across from Together, creating a well-lit walking park and community garden. This will be a safe recreational space where people can enjoy the outdoors and gain physical exercise.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The funds will be allocated across the four component parts of the proposal as outlined in the project budget. Furthermore, the project budget includes a breakout of costs across both the phases of project work and the yearly layout of funds toward the completion date in 2026. 

Across the four primary proposal areas, we have delineated any costs associated with acquisition, demolition, construction, and other soft costs (improvements, furniture, surveys, architectural design, etc.). In different project areas, these cost categories may or may not apply. The funds will transform the usage, access, and well-being of the Columbus Park neighborhood area. The costs have all gone through rigorous scrutiny by experienced architects and contractors who have provided final bids for the projects. 

The funds will be used comprehensively in the project plan and the work described in this proposal will be completed in its entirety. The funds will be used in combination with other private sources creating a public/private partnership, work product, and impact on the community.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Together will serve as the lead agency for the fiscal management of the funds. Other participating agencies will operate under MOUs, and each is a current legal entity subject to customary and rigorous accounting practices and reviews.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> For the major areas of supplemental funding, we have begun the process of seeking private funding for the Together facility expansion and are well underway with scheduled meetings with funders. For the apartments and affordable housing initiatives, additional funding will be through tax increment financing, tax credits, and traditional construction loans.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> Given we are already underway with the project planning, we anticipate finalizing the supplemental funding during the balance of 2022 and in early 2023. Some commitments may be spread over a two- to three-year period.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> There are certain elements of the plan that would have to be re-evaluated to go forward if funding were not awarded.  The main financial elements, the Together facility expansion and affordable housing expansion, would have increased risk for completion.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> The Columbus Park Neighborhood Improvement Project is an integrated single proposal for the betterment of the Leavenworth business district and the Columbus Park neighborhood, but the project is scalable.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> While the Columbus Park Neighborhood Improvement Project is a cohesive plan to execute a community-wide vision, it can be completed in smaller components. The project is comprised of four distinct modules—facility development, neighborhood improvement, transportation, and affordable housing—and is scalable at this component level. Additionally, three of the four components are distinct projects that may be enhanced, modified, phased, or eliminated during the evaluation or legislative processes. However, the facility development component, as a shovel ready project, is not individually scalable.    We recognize that to make the best possible use of funds, the ongoing ARPA review process will involve continuing flexibility on the part of applicants. With that in mind, we memorialized our ongoing business arrangement in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Heartland B-Cycle, the Columbus Park Neighborhood Association, JDP Holdings, and the RMD Real Estate Group in preparation for this opportunity. This MOU eliminates confusion regarding things like scalability and ensures all project partners recognize the adaptability required in submitting this proposal.    Additionally, this proposal contemplates scaling up through collaboration with several indirect partners outside the scope of this proposal. There are at least five essential organizations—Together, Completely Kids, CASA for Douglas County, Youth Emergency Services, and Lutheran Family Services of Omaha—located in a rather compact six-block area near 24th Street between Leavenworth and Dodge. These organizations provide a full gamut of essential services to mitigate the corrosive effects of poverty. As mission-driven public service organizations, we recognize that private and public dollars devoted to our organizations are precious commodities and that it is incumbent on us to eliminate duplication, optimize services, facilitate regular communication, and share resources when possible. In preparation for this proposal, Together has met with Completely Kids, Youth Emergency Services, Lutheran Family Services, DIBS and CASA to lay the groundwork for this community effort. As time unfolds, we will continue to strengthen these relationships to the benefit of the organizations and the community in this central core of Omaha. </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> Together and its partners have already committed funds to the facility development component and pieces of the neighborhood improvement components of this project. Together has made expenditures to complete due diligence work in preparation for the fundraising phase of the organization’s facility development. To date, Together has spent over $275,000 on surveys, title searches, Geotech environmental assessments and engineering, structural assessments, and other planning necessary to complete the schematic design and construction documents for its proposed facility.</p>
