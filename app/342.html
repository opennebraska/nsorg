  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Skatefest Omaha uses skateboarding and art to provide Black and Brown youth in with access to safe spaces and mentoring, increase diversity, provide hands on learning experiences and a platform for self-expression. Skatefest Omaha is founded and led by Executive Director, Blake Harris, a young Black man with a passion for skateboarding. SkateFest Omaha is normalizing and amplifying the voices of marginalized people through our skateboarding events and programming.
We will teach skateboarding to youth, community art classes partnered with local organizations/BIPOC professionals such as Creative Impulse by Jennifer Young. Community Music classes partnered with local organizations/BIPOC professionals. Classes teaching Financial literacy/wealth development and entrepreneurship to young adults and local families. Classes educating on the importance of Mental health 
Provide first time employment experience to high school students and young adults. Programming partnered with local BIPOC organizations and professionals. We will focus on hiring local high school students/young adults and provide workforce training programs for those new to the workforce. 
Civic uses:
The Space will also serve as an event venue for neighborhood meetings, social gatherings, and other multipurpose uses. Space will be a concert venue hosting local and regional artists. Local monthly vendor markets will be hosted focusing on small business, artists, non-profits, and BIPOC entrepreneurs. Easily accessible facility providing youth and young adults a physical health outlet. 
Recreation:
This project will enhance recreation in east Omaha because there is a large skateboarding population but no skatepark indoors. Nebraska has cruel winters leaving this large population subject to negative mental health and physical health issues. During the winter
This facility will encourage youth to stay active during the winter
This facility will encourage youth and young adults to stay out of trouble leading to gangs and violence. 
The facility encourages people to skateboard and use public transportation with 13 bus stops around a 2 block radius. Soon there will be a street car going to Harney making this location more easily accessible. Space will greatly improve the district it’s in by bringing more people from all over omaha/region through events, regional skateboarding competitions, Concerts, and art shows/exhibits to the area encouraging more investment into the neighborhood. Bringing a BIPOC mixed use culture destination will enhance the area. Having an easily accessible safe space for at risk youth will improve the drug and gang violence in area making it a safer area for low income families to thrive. As of now the spot is a run down building, there are lots of broken down buildings nearby. Renovating and developing this space will improve the overall look of the neighborhood. Bring murals to the area from local artists, community garden along the side of the lot for locals. An indoor skatepark serves as a great health benefit for locals and provides an easily accessible exercise facility which will increase health benefits to youth and young adults encouraging a healthier lifestyle.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The skatepark facility will address some of the visioning workshop finding. Strengths addressed, Project is located inside an abandoned building with lots of upgrades needed. With so much work needed to the building, it would have most likely sit for years. This project will revitalize the building which would have otherwise been left vacant. This project will be ran by Blake Harris,BIPOC Executive Director from the community who lives in the community. With the rail car coming through Harney Street, it will be for BIPOC to get equity in this area. Lack of black owned companies that attract others from outside the community
With the Bay in Lincoln moving to an all youth facility, and young adults/adults having nowhere to skateboard in the winter, this will attract and serve people from all walks of life, all over the region. The facility will be BIPOC owned and operated. Weaknesses the project addresses: Need meeting space, community space 
This project will serve as a community space for youth, young adults, artists, musicians.
Will be available for meetings, gatherings, events, arts, music performances, concerts, etc. We will have meeting space upstairs available for local community. Negative perceptions of south Omaha immigrant and diverse
This project will help change that stigma bringing lots of positivity into the area
Being a regional hub, people from all over will be able to come to east Omaha showing people the goodness of it and changing perceptions
Systemic racism, poverty, and redlining. This project directly attacks this by bringing a new state of the art facility into the area. Mental health for middle and high school students. Behavioral health issues with these children. Our main target audience is middle and high school students, by moving forward with this project we will be able to directly invest into these youth teaching them mental health and training them on behavioral health.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Skateboarding addresses public health turmoil. The Skatefest Headquarters is an easily accessible facility to practice what they love and exercise, especially during the winter months. Through our proposed facility, we will provide a place for BIPOC communities to thrive physically, financially through financial literacy and wealth development, job training and career readiness. We will also address the needs for assistance for small businesses owners by highlighting local BIPOC businesses.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Our programming will prepare youth and young adults to enter into college, the workforce and or entrepreneurship through programs and training provided through collaborations with local organizations such as College possible, 100 Black Men of Omaha, Heartland Workforce Solutions. For contractors, we plan on opening two more locations in north and south omaha to increase job opportunities and economic viability.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Skateparks are one of the fastest growing recreational activities in the United States. Skateboarding youth often prove to be incredible advocates for the things that are important to them, and the long process of skatepark development is transformative not just for the skateboarders but for the community.  By hiring BIPOC from the community we can create a diversified staff that represents the community we live in. Developing between North and South Omaha creates accessibility to both communities for representation. The space will allow economic and wealth creation opportunities by providing financial literacy courses and bays for BIPOC small businesses, nonprofits, entrepreneurs, and Creatives. Local Omaha researchers with Omaha Police Department have provided evidence that proves when a Neighborhood is cleaned and cared for, violence and crime decreases by 75% and community livability and pride increases. The indoor skatepark would serve as a community hub for youth and young adults to be active, engage in community events and programming.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> We plan to utilize the skatepark as an accessible space for teaching financial literacy and wealth development in the neighborhood to allow for families to better understand how to grow their finances and manage their income.  We will also teach workforce development to create employability among youth and young adults to include resume writing and internal job opportunities. 
Quality of Life; there is data to show health benefits to skateboarding including cardio, increased positive outcomes for mental health and confidence. Data provided by Abide and the Omaha Police Department shows when a neighborhood is clean and cared for, crime and violence is decreased by 75%. We anticipate murals and green spaces to improve the neighborhood and instill a renewed sense of pride.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> According to Tony Hawk Project, more than 6 million visitors annually visit Skateparks throughout the United States. INNOVATION There has never been a skatepark, youth programming, artist engagement, music venue in omaha. People will flock from the region to check this place out.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Additional outcomes we will measure are: Improved financial education for low income BIPOC families and young adults. Number of participants attending classes, demographics such as age, area codes. We will track Improved soft and hard skills learned from SK8 school, media and marketing classes, art classes, mental health practices and yoga through providing surveys at the end of each program session. We will track employability for local high school students and young adults through keeping track of attendance, classes completed, resumes built, and jobs received through the program. New high paying jobs for administrative staff and competitive wages for facility staff we will Keep track by keeping count of staff and wages.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The outcomes will be measured through surveys, listening sessions and assessments conducted by our Program Manager. We also intend to have additional comprehensive development of our data through STEPS at the University of Nebraska Omaha.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> The Skatepark will create a regional creative hub centered around skateboarding, music, and art will attract more small businesses to the area as well as local and national investors. Occupying the space will greatly improve the district it’s in by bringing more people from all over omaha/region to the area through large events from skateboarding, art exhibits, and concerts encouraging more investment into the neighborhood Soon, the streetcar will be going through the area leading to great access to the area from all over and ultimately bringing more investment, it’s important to get BIPOC equity and an organization centered around bipoc growth</p>
