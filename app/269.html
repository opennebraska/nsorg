  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> SheMate is enhancing the sports industry for women through community and publicity. Over 2300 collegiate, professional, Olympic, and Paralympic athletes have applied to join the SheMate community since starting in November 2021. SheMate connects this community to the youth sports industry through interactive virtual mentoring and consultation to provide strategy and support for navigating sport, life goals, and transitions. In addition to direct support for youth in sport and their parents and coaches, SheMate increases positive representation of women on-screen by increasing media coverage for female athletes. SheMate submits this proposal to add in-person offerings to SheMate’s list of services. Developing a physical SheMate space in North or South Omaha will directly connect SheMate’s diverse community of athletes with the local community. This physical hub will serve as a community space to integrate mental and physical wellness, healthy activity, body positivity, therapeutic strategies, and safety to progress toward holistic wellness by way of meaningful support from SheMate athletes all across the country.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> 2022: build community of diverse athletes, develop brand, deepen research, and form community partners. 2023: procure physical headquarters in Omaha and LOIs from universities, K12 school districts, and nonprofits. 2024: open community center for in-person holistic healthy living by way of community.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The establishment of a physical SheMate location in Omaha aligns with community needs. SheMate creates recreation and holistic health activations for North and/or South Omaha, requires high-quality broadband, and creates opportunities for mixed use spaces.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> SheMate places priority focus on community involvement and input, with particular attention on diversifying visibility and representation of women on-screen. Broadband and transit required for SheMate will generate increased demand for community-wide resources and access. Agile ability for SheMate to activate existing vacant building enables revitalization and job opportunities. SheMate is a for-profit business driven by the belief that women should be paid for their work; vision requires intersectional lens, recognizing that without explicit inclusion of Black and Brown women and gender-expansive athletes and fans, it is impossible to enact vision. Potential for SheMate to connect North and/or South Omaha to downtown depending on building assignment through LB1024 funding and lack of displacement required for SheMate to occupy a space. SheMate utilizes media and prohibits negative depictions of North and South Omaha. The success of SheMate requires, encourages, and celebrates community involvement and positive community engagement opportunities. SheMate adheres to both the needs of mental health and the right to mental wellness while promoting holistic wellness in the forms of physical, mental, and community health.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> SheMate supports and contributes to positive economic, social, and community-health within North and South Omaha communities, and brings jobs with livable wages to North and South Omaha communities. Business development in North and South Omaha will occur through the SheMate community hub; local and far-reaching partnerships are part of SheMate, ensuring mutual benefit.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> SheMate will produce revenue in the next five years through university, K12, and media partnerships, all with a focus on connecting diverse community of SheMate athletes with youth and their parents, coaches, and school staff. This business model will expand throughout the country to produce sustainable revenue growth YoY.</p>
