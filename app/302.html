  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Both youth and seniors need a safe environment to learn, meet others and become comfortable with managing their finances.  Our training programs will have a positive impact to avoid homelessness among both youth & seniors.  This can be avoided by learning cybersecurity to protect their identity and their financial well-being by not becoming a victim or target for fraud. Personal development,  and mentoring will provide continuing support and growth  for businesses and the customers they serve.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Lack of social connections due to covid-19 shut downs will now be inspired by giving options for students to learn virtually or in-person.  Jobs will become available as the businesses are developed, hire employees and stabilize their income again,  The lack of income, family loss or health issues can be reversed by education and awareness for businesses to manage their finances for trouble times like shut-downs.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Sustainability is a priority that YBusiness Solutions Training Academy could achieve. According to U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 National Population Projections, by 2030 all baby boomers will be older than age 65.  Therefore, education will be required to teach youth at an early age to produce and serve this population.  Also, seniors who want to start a business for other seniors would benefit the community by serving their needs, stabilizing their finances while enjoying life, or become independent.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The anticipated job creation for our company will be 5 to 6 permanent employees
The proposed jobs will be as follows:
Staff & Interns $20hr/8 hours per week
Administrator $35hr/20hrs per week 
Marketing staff $1200 per month
(2) Technical staff $3000 per month 
The anticipated job creation for the youth and seniors to hire others are endless.  For every 30 students we teach, if only 5 start a business, and hire up to 25 employees, would generate up to 1500 jobs for these small businesses.  According to the Small business Administration, small companies create 1.5 million jobs annually and account for 64% of new jobs created in the United States.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> This proposal will create improvement to the North and South Omaha community by creating opportunities for youth and high school students to learn how to start a business, understand taxes, control their finances and develop themselves using their gifts while discovering purpose.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The community benefits from networking, building relationships and learning from others. Being taught by seasoned business owners who have been successful in the same community will greatly impact the quality of life of others.   If you never own, manage or started a business, people tend to not learn from the in-experienced.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Starting a business brings excitement, joy and overwhelming support in Omaha.  Media can bring positive energy within the community.  Our goal is to use funds to generate awareness, shine light on the new business, create opportunities for new digital ideas to continue educational programs for various types of businesses. Free advertising, creating awareness, using social media, annual awards, showcases and any other ideas created to support youth and senior who completes these programs. This would be no cost to the businesses who successfully launch their business from completing programs from this proposal.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Improving the education for youth as early as age nine will impact their mental and physical development.  This stage is when they begin to understand and know right from wrong. Our program will measure outcomes by the effects of encouragement, personal development and self-discovery.  The ability to structure their thoughts will also be measure by assessment & enrollment questioners to gage understanding..</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The Brandon Hall Group’s is learning measurement tool often use to measure the learning and performance of a program.  This model will allow our program to measure the specific learning outcomes to identify the learning programs impact on the organizational outcomes before starting</p>
