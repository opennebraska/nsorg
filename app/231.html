  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Over the last decade, as prices sky-rocketed, preschool has been reserved solely for the affluent. With waiting lists over a year long, and prices nearing $1000 a month, many families are forced to keep their children in traditional daycare until enrolling them in kindergarten. While there are some government funded early learning programs in Nebraska, the spaces are limited, and the restrictions are numerous. This poses a particular threat to families living in poverty. Preschool is the first step into education. It is a chance to open the mind of a child. This is the basis by which all future learning is possible. King’s Landing will become a pillar of the community, offering affordable education for North Omaha children ages three to five years old. Children will have the opportunity to grow and thrive in an environment centered around fine arts, science and mathematics, sustainability and environmental awareness. The educators at King’s Landing will focus on the development of the following:
-Emotion Management
-Social Skills
-Fine Motor Skills
-Early Math Skills
-Early Literacy Skills</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> King’s Landing will become a pillar of the community, offering affordable preschool education for North Omaha families. Children will have the opportunity to grow and thrive in an environment centered around fine arts, science and mathematics, sustainability and environmental awareness.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> North Omaha's most urgent needs, according to the assessment chart, pertain to sustaining the community and policy. The two categories combined make up 77% of the total. Education is a key part of both of these community needs, particularly early childhood development for children ages three to five years old. As stated, this development is key to future success of North Omaha youth. Pre-primary education is critical to longevity in the school system and continued education.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Creating thriving businesses offsets the challenges of disproportionate low-income minority communities such as North Omaha. For generations, North Omaha has been plagued with disparities that stifled the ability of individuals to access funds for small businesses, real estate, and any resources that could potentially change the trajectory of wealth. LB1024 recognizes those challenges and attempts to assist with areas that could minimize such disparities. King's Landing attempts to not only impact and advance student experiences prior to their formal education ,but it incites a spirit of pride in the community. King's Landing also provides potential job employment for local North Omaha residents, as well as lasting partnerships for its community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> An educational institution centered around fine arts, STEM, community sustainability and environmental awareness is something that is not only new to North Omaha, but also traditionally unheard of in the African American Community itself.

This pre-primary institution will also incite parental engagement with opportunities for continued education.</p>
