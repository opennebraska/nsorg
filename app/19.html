  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> 1. Greater Community Involvement of Business Owners
Volunteer work, charitable donations, or participating in community festivals and events are all common for small business owners. 

2. Increase Community Economic Health
Local businesses tend to support other local businesses. An area eatery may need cleaning services, legal assistance, or an accountant to reconcile bills and process payroll. Many times, a localized company will deliberately patronize other local businesses to create a thriving local economy. Bolstering sales of their friends and neighbors creates strong community bonds and keeps money in the community, instead of sending it to corporate shareholders.
Shopping local also means creating more jobs in the community. These local workers will spend their money in town, promoting the economic cycle. Additionally, employees of small businesses tend to be happier ―70% of small business employees reported their happiness level to be a 5 or higher on a scale of 1 to 10.

3.Promote Environmental Friendly

Many locally owned businesses are part of an overall downtown revitalization process. Older downtown buildings have been remodeled and repurposed for different businesses, and the structures themselves don’t typically lend themselves to a big box retailer occupant. These smart growth places also reduce environmental damage from the new building projects, especially multi-acre corporate warehouse stores with enormous parking lots. A compact building can also help protect ecologically sensitive areas of the community and reduce urban blight common in downtown areas where shopping malls have taken over.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported that clusters of small businesses in a walkable area, or near residential areas, may reduce car usage and encourage biking and walking for shoppers. Areas of the city designed for walking and outdoor shopping help reduce emissions from vehicles, improving the air quality. Traffic congestion is lessened, making the streets safer and a better experience for those driving in the community.
Small business owners looking for a storefront can take advantage of older, historic buildings that give a sense of charm and uniqueness to their shop. Additionally, 66.3% of small business owners use recycled materials. Protecting the environmental health of your community is an indirect way that small businesses can improve their towns.

4. Encourage Entrepreneurship
A community with successful small businesses inspires others to take that leap and develop their own passion. Starting a small business means that the owner is taking charge of their future through innovation and prosperity. Other like-minded individuals may follow suit, seeing the success of small businesses. In towns where business regulations and tax credits are beneficial to small businesses, it’s easier for those with drive and perseverance to succeed.
5. Create Local Jobs
According to the U.S. Small Business Administration’s August 2017 Small Business Quarterly Bulletin, small businesses have created two out of every three net new jobs since 2014. This is more than most people would think, but every local job that’s created means that more people are able to stay in their community. An overwhelming majority of people leave small towns and mid-sized cities for better job opportunities. A city with a thriving small business environment encourages people to stay, making it economically feasible to do so.
Local workers may shop locally, as well, maintaining the cash flow throughout a town. Rather than commuting to a neighboring city, people are able to work closer to home, improving the quality of life for many. Many people choose to shop and dine near their workplace; for those working in their own town, this may mean running errands in local shops, grabbing lunch or after-work drinks at a local pub or eatery, and patronizing local shops for clothing or hobby supplies. Money stays local and the community vibes.</p>
