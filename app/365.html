  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> This proposal addresses assistance for small businesses, job training, employee resources, business development, and housing needs for persons disproportionately underrepresented economically because of structural practices such as racial segregation and historical practices such as redlining.

Our desire is to increase the number of affluent North Omaha citizens. We will accomplish this through community collaboration and construction of our SOAR Center, adjacent to our Senior Housing project (separately leveraged). We aspire to be an educational, health and wellness, and entrepreneurial resource to our North Omaha community.

Our education component seeks to provide connections and resources for P-12 institutions, space for parent engagement and educator professional development opportunities, as well as a setting where students can receive tutoring.

The health and wellness portion of our facility will provide resources for individuals to maintain or improve their physical fitness. Additionally, we will collaborate with local healthcare providers to offer periodic health and wellness checks. We will host back-to-school drives offering practical and concrete needs, such as backpacks and haircuts to students.

We will provide employment resources and job training programs for community members. We will connect individuals with job opportunities and help them gain the skills and resources they need to be successful.

We will also be a place where small business owners can connect with resources and opportunities, as well as tap into our knowledge base to expand their ventures. We believe that by providing such resources we can empower our community and set North Omaha on a trajectory for long-term, generational change.

SOAR Center is currently in the design planning and financing phase. We plan to break ground in early 2023 and be open in February 2024.

We are committed to being a space for the community and by the community. Our steering committee currently consists of individuals who represent key stakeholders in the education, health and wellness, entrepreneurship, and small business arenas. Our future Board will help us to make sure that we are responsive to community needs and wants. We know that as we grow, our Board will expand to include individuals from a wider swath of the community.</p>

Higher Education and Vocational Prep

We seek to provide higher education and vocational prep programs for individuals in our community. This may include potential tuition assistance/scholarships, financial aid counseling, and academic advising. These services will help individuals to access and succeed in higher education and vocational programs.

Coding Programs

We seek to partner with local organizations to provide high-quality coding instruction to young people in our community as this will help them develop important skills that will benefit them throughout their lives.

Employment Resources

We will provide employment resources to community members. This will include resume writing assistance, job search assistance (i.e job fairs), and career counseling. These services will help individuals find and obtain gainful employment.

Job Training

We will also provide job training programs for individuals. This may include skills training, certification assistance, and job placement assistance. These services will help individuals to find and obtain gainful employment.

Local EPP Partnerships

We seek to partner with local Educator Preparation Programs (EPPs) to place teacher trainees in our STEAM center. This will provide us with an ongoing source of enthusiastic and motivated teachers and will help us to build strong relationships with

the schools where they will teach. In addition, we believe that this partnership will provide valuable feedback on the effectiveness of our center, and will help us to continually improve its impact.

Recording Studio

A recording studio is an important asset for any community, providing a space for local business owners, entrepreneurs, and musicians to develop their skills and produce high-quality recordings. Podcasts and videos are great ways for entrepreneurs to reach a wider audience, share their stories, and connect with potential customers. Our recording studio will help entrepreneurs produce high-quality podcasts and professional-looking videos that will engage their audience and help them grow their businesses. Additionally, a well-equipped studio can help new and unsigned artists to produce professional-sounding recordings, giving them a better chance at success. Unsigned artists often lack the funds necessary to purchase expensive recording equipment or to rent time in a professional studio. As a result, many talented individuals are unable to pursue their musical dreams.

Health and Wellness

We will provide community access to health and wellness. Our gymnasium will be a hub for walking groups, and workout classes. We will also provide support for keeping health and wellness at the forefront of one's path by seeking collaboration that offer free periodical basic health and wellness checks. Additionally, we will have a back to school drive offering practical and concrete needs, such as backpacks and haircuts.

Entrepreneurship Support

Our desire is to increase the number of affluent North Omaha citizens. This happens from teaching entrepreneurship and financial markets education and empowerment. One way to support entrepreneurs is by providing access to modeling and mentorship. This will come from experienced business people, successful entrepreneurs, or specialized service providers. By providing modeling and mentorship, we can help entrepreneurs to avoid common mistakes, learn about new opportunities, and gain valuable insigh</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Addressing financial instability and reaching for measurable wealth are principal desires amplified during the visioning workshops and this project is designed specifically to have measurable impact. Our vision aligns with the findings in the Visioning Workshop Summary because our plan will help increase the number of affluent North Omaha citizens. This happens from teaching entrepreneurship and financial markets education and empowerment. We teach thought process first…then changing habits…then changing your outcome to positively impact your legacy and community. In other

communities it is very normal for your neighbors to own successful companies, so children grow up thinking they ought to achieve the same. In other words, it’s not a stretch goal for them to see themselves owning a business and reaching financial dignity. The way we have perpetual, transformational and generational change is to have hundreds of people who see dozens of successful Black business owners. We are creating a pipeline that will continue to grow as it will become the “norm” to see successful Black families achieve wealth and financial independence. These dozens will in turn become hundreds of Black business owners who teach thousands of community members…so on and so forth. There’s been a concerted effort to partner with black and brown entrepreneurs and professionals who will walk participants through the steps of starting, growing and scaling their companies. These dedicated stakeholders will give one on one coaching on our campus.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal addresses assistance for small businesses, job training, employee resources, business development, and housing needs for persons disproportionately underrepresented economically because of structural practices such as racial segregation and historical practices such as redlining. The housing component of this proposal is the senior living housing, which is separately funded and adjacent to the SOAR (Strengths, Opportunities, Access and Results) Center. SOAR is an educational center dedicated to wellness, wealth-building, and access to resources for the community.

Through our education component, we plan to provide connection and resources for P-12 institutions and space for parent engagement opportunities. We envision a setting where students can get tutoring in core academic areas as well as instruction in coding or other courses that may help them succeed at higher levels of learning. In addition, we can also be a space where educators can come together to collaborate as they seek to teach and lead in our local classrooms.The educational component includes connection to schools and community, offering meeting space for parent engagement, tutoring with partnering schools, financial literacy, financial education, asset development, business principles, wealth navigation, and entrepreneurial coaching.

Our health and wellness facility includes a gymnasium with community access, a walking group to support a sense of community and safety, and overall personal agency. We will provide workout classes that support individual aspirations and goals. Keeping health and wellness at the forefront of one's path assists in promoting emotional longevity, confidence, and security. We will seek collaboration for free periodical basic health and wellness checks. Additionally, we know in census tract 73.12, which is adjacent to qualifying census tracts, we will have a back to school drive offering practical and concrete needs, such as backpacks and haircuts.
