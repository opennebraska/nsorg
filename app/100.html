  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Ernie Chambers History-Arts-Humanities Multicultural Center is the first step in Together We Achieve Miracles (TWAM)'s long-term mission of developing the Saratoga-Beltline History & Arts District in North Omaha, using the multicultural center as the core location. This district revitalization project aims to beautify and modernize North Omaha by increasing tourist attractions (legacy library, historical car show tour, North Omaha Trail Bus Tour, an interactive family tourism museum site), food & shopping centers, as well as diverse dining options around the multicultural center.  To add and increase tourism in Omaha as a whole, the Saratoga-Beltline History & Arts District is comparative to Downtown Omaha's Old Market but located in the North Omaha area. Since Saratoga was once known to be a bustling business mecca, in partnership with Alley Poyner, TWAM will honor Saratoga's historic roots and ultimately expand the Multicultural Center's economic development into the surrounding area. Due to the ARPA funds 2-year spending window, we're asking for $49M to complete Phase 1 of the Saratoga Arts & History District project, the construction of the Ernie Chambers History-Arts-Humanities Multicultural Center. The mission of TWAM is to educate, provide, and inspire the people of Omaha and beyond by providing access to local history and humanities with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). TWAM’s vision is for our headquarters to be a welcoming and safe community space that offers accessible resources to increase its visitors’ history and humanities knowledge. In turn, the hope is to revitalize North Omaha’s image and increase its visibility and tourism.</p>

  <p> Legal Description: Oak Chatham Lot 12, Block 1 ½ Vacated Boyd Street and All vacated alley adjacent and south, 49 feet lot 3 and all lots 4 through 11 and south 32 feet. Oak Chatham Addition. Ernie Chambers History-Arts-Humanities Multicultural Center is located at 4402 Florence Boulevard and 4401 North 21st Street Omaha, Nebraska 68110 is in North Omaha. The commercial node at North 20th and Ames Avenue is comprised of commercial and industrial properties with single family residences scattered throughout. The building contributes to the Saratoga-Beltline Railroad Trail Way Economic Vitality Preservation District. The Saratoga neighborhood was founded in 1856 by a group of land speculators but continued to thrive after the speculators returned to their homes on the east coast. Throughout the end of the nineteenth century to the twentieth century, the Saratoga neighborhood thrived with a school, social halls, theatres, and businesses that supported the residents of the area. The Beltline Railroad began in 1883, was completed in 1886 with a branch of the line along Boyd Street through the Saratoga neighborhood and immediately adjacent to this building. The Beltline originally served both passengers and commerce, shifted to only commercial delivery of goods because Omaha had a well-established streetcar line to serve passengers. This building was built by the Imperial Sash and Door Company in 1919. The company constructed for their use at this location, easier access to the Beltline rail tracks that ran along the south side of the building. The canted south wall reveals where the tracks formerly accessed the building. Imperial Sash and Door occupied the space until 1932 when the company went bankrupt, and its assets were sold at auction. It was remodeled in 1935 for a new tenant, the Oliver Farm Equipment Company. The Oliver Company eventually purchased the building from then owner, J.J. Fitzgerald Company in 1943, after renting for nine years. Oliver Company manufactured all types of farm machinery. In 1956, the Lozier Company purchased the building for their refrigeration and air conditioning firm. This 55,000 square foot building allowed Lozier to expand their company facilities and they grew their company to a national presence here. Lozier occupied the building until the 1990s when they vacated it and donated it to the Omaha Housing Authority. The historic period it was continuously occupied by commercial enterprises that took advantage of its location adjacent to the railroad tracks for their continued success. Three major businesses were located here from the Imperial Sash and Door company that constructed the building in 1919, to the Oliver Company in 1935, and with Lozier from 1956 through the late 1980s and early 1990s. This continued occupation added to a stable economically diverse neighborhood and provided employment within the community. The Lozier Company was started in 1937 and incorporated in 1961 and remains an important industry leader with roots in Omaha Allan Lozier began working at 14 years old, for his family businesses that started out of their garage for refrigeration and repairs and today has evolved into store fixtures and other retail display systems. Lozier is the largest national company in store manufacture display systems in the United States, still headquartered in Omaha. Their efforts to maintain, modernize, and preserve the building leaving a legacy in the neighborhood. In 2018 the building for auction by Omaha Housing Authority and was sold to Legacy Property LLC which current own the property. Legacy Property LLC, currently in lease agreement with Together We Achieve Miracles Inc nonprofit organization will help with the develop and will manage the Ernie Chambers History-Arts- Humanities Multicultural Center.
