  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Chosen 1 Child Development Center will continue to serve families and children by providing high quality care and education.  We would like to upgrade our playground area, so the children have a safe place to explore.  We would like to increase our capacity by adding two infant classrooms and one toddler classroom.  There will be a need to hire a full-time director and 4 Early Childhood Educators to ensure ratios are met daily.  We would like to upgrade our van and continue with transportation, the ECE that we hire will also be able to drive the van.  We would like to update the office supplies and be able to pay for adequate trainings for staff and educators.  Our location will remain the same and we will expand the spaces we already occupy.  We are hoping the timeline is completed in thirty-six months.</p>
