  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Omaha was making measurable progress before the pandemic hit. The Empowerment Network is one of the catalysts and collective impact organizations that had helped to: create an 80% reduction in gun violence during summer months in North Omaha; decrease African-American unemployment from 20.7% to 7.5%; decrease African-American youth unemployment by 45%; and, increase the graduation rate for African-American students from 64% to 81% over a 10 year period. COVID-19 has reversed some of these trends, but the statistics have not returned to the same level as before the Network started.  There’s more work to do, but positive transformation is occurring driven by residents and leaders in the community most impacted by poverty.

The Empowerment Network is recognized for its role in working with partners to develop and implement collaborative approaches to help achieve the following outcomes and results: 1) increasing graduation rates and academic performance; 2) reducing gun and gang violence; 3) increasing the number of college graduates; 4) increasing the number of African-American owned businesses; 5) reducing unemployment and being a catalyst for economic development in North Omaha; 6) engaging thousands of residents in specific strategies to improve their community; 7) recruiting mentors and partner agencies to work with youth in schools; 8) building the capacity of neighborhood organizations and other non-profits; 9) providing data and research to assist with informed decision-making; 10) and, creating leadership development programs for corporate and non-profit employees.

Our next level of innovation expands on this, addressing inequality and building community wealth through intergenerational, career pathway jobs and home/business ownership.  Shifting our Step-Up focus to STEAM, our youth will be better prepared for the emerging/future regional economy and families will benefit from a multi-generational approach focused on career advancement, increasing wages and building legacy wealth.  With this proposal, the Network seeks to go even further upstream and greater formal alignment of key strategies.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Prior to the pandemic, the Empowerment Network Collaborative with data provided by the UNO Research Division and other sources was able to document measurable progress in eight of 10 areas in the Transformation Plan.  During the peak of the pandemic, the Network shifted to leading coordination of efforts to connect residents to needed services and meeting needs brought on by the crisis.  In addition to regular responsibilities, the Network worked with community partners, elected officials and others to connect residents to housing, job training, health services and food. 

The collaborative work has been recognized by the Obama Foundation, Department of Justice, University of Nebraska-Omaha, Baylor University, Harvard University and others as a best practice, evidence-based model.  The Empowerment Network has successfully managed millions of dollars from public and private sources including the City of Omaha, Charles E Lakin Foundation, Weitz Family Foundation, State of Nebraska, Douglas County, Health and Human Services, HUD, Obama Foundation, local foundations, Fortune 500 corporations and other sources.  In addition, the Network has worked with hundreds of community partners to develop and implement collective strategies.  

The plan submitted here will allow the Empowerment Network to build capacity over the next few years to continue showing what is possible through collaborative action.  The goal for the plan is to show once again the economic and social impact of the collective work.  The Network will use the evidence to secure and increase local and national funding.  In addition, the Network will expand its earned revenue strategy to create a self-sufficiency model and build capacity of the community to invest in itself. 

The strategies identified in this project include:  Village Empowerment Center, Step-Up Omaha STEAM expansion, Skill Up Employment Program for Adults, Redefine the Game Career Advancement Program, Legacy Wealth Initiative, Violence Prevention Programs including Community Partners, Churches and Neighborhoods, 24th and Lake Events and Activities, Capacity-Building in the areas of Financial Management and Evaluation; and Operational support to execute and implement the project.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Timeline
Upon approval of the funds, the Empowerment Network will expand each component of the program outline.  Most of the initiatives are already in existence and will simply need to be expanded.
1.	Village Empowerment Center (VEC) – quotes have been gathered and vendors are identified that can do the work.  Upon approval of the funds, the Village Empowerment Center can be renovated within 3 to 6 months.
2.	Step-Up Omaha STEAM expansion – Upon approval of the ARPA funds, Step-Up Omaha’s STEAM program will be expanded beginning in the summer of 2023.
3.	Step-Up Youth-direct Investment Fund – Interns will conduct research during spring of 2023 and allocate funds in 2023, 2024 and 2025.
4.	Skill-Up Omaha for Adults 19-34 – Upon approval of the ARPA funds, Step-Up Omaha’s Skill-Up program will begin in the fall of 2023.  Through surveys, Step-Up has already started the process of identify parents and relatives in need of job training, education and other services that can be offered at the VEC and through community partners.
5.	The Redefine the Game Institute – The next cohort will kick off in Jan/Feb of 2023.  Anticipating that ARPA funds will not be approved until spring of 2023, the 2024 cohort will be the first to be expanded. Another option would be to wait until approval and launch the 5th cohort in late spring with the additional funding.
6.	The Legacy Wealth Initiative – The 3rd cohort of the Legacy Wealth Initiative can be launched in late spring of 2023.  The goal would be to complete the third cohort in 2023 and connect them to a Collective Investment Opportunity in 2024.  Research for the project could be conducted in 2023 in order to be prepared for implementation in 2024.  There will be multiple cohorts to reach the number of participants.
7.	The Omaha 360 and Neighborhood Capacity projects would begin as soon as funding is approved.  Because a structure already exists to sub-contract with churches and neighborhoods, the initiative could be expanded quickly and ready for implementation in advance of summer 2023 and before Native Omaha Days.  
8.	The 24th and Lake Events and Activities can be expanded as early as spring/summer 2023.
9.	The North Omaha Financial Collaborative and North Omaha Evaluation efforts can be in place by spring of 2023.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal seeks to accelerate the pace of progress in Omaha by expanding these efforts:

Village Empowerment Center – a one-stop shop location at 52nd and Ames that connects youth and their families to health, housing, financial, entrepreneurship and employment services.  The location has already served thousands of families and with funds dedicated will work to connect 500 youth and 500 adults to the workforce with the skills necessary for success.  The Village Empowerment Center has been supported by the Obama Foundation, Google, Mutual of Omaha, Cox Communications and others.

The Village Empowerment Center is also home to the Step-Up Omaha’s STEAM program which connects youth to career and hands on training in the areas of Drones, Robotics, Sound Engineering, Culinary Arts, Entrepreneurship and other emerging fields.  The vision is to also expose their parents and relatives to the same opportunities through Skill-Up Omaha.

Another component with the youth is to create a Youth-directed Investment Fund.  Based on the work of Step-Up Omaha, youth and young adults will have funds that they can decide how to allocate based on their priorities.  This will be critical to engage youth in the process to improve their community with real dollars.  Each year, prior to the pandemic, Step-Up youth would study the City of Omaha budget and present their recommendations and funding priorities during a mock City Council meeting.  This will take that activity much further by allowing them to actually decide where to invest $500,000 per year for the next three years.  The Network would be the fiscal agent for the process.

In addition, the Pathway includes the Redefine the Game (RTG) Institute focused on career advancement and leadership development.  Over the past four years, over 125 African-American professionals have graduated from the course with 70% receiving promotions or advanced opportunities at their workplace.  With support from the ARPA funds, RTG will seek to advance 500 professionals in their careers which will substantially increase wages generated in the community and create disposable income that can support local businesses.  The Institute is lead by national facilitators Dr. Randal Pinkett and Dr. Jeffrey Robinson.  The goal is to increase the number of African-Americans and North Omaha residents in the C-Suite or VP/Director level positions to be more representative of the demographics in the region.  Having more African-Americans and North Omaha residents in leadership levels will have a measurable and dramatic impact for the community.  Graduates from the first four cohorts include two African-American Deputy Chiefs with the Omaha Police Department, new entrepreneurs, the lead HR executive at OPPD, and executive level leaders at Union Pacific, American National Bank, Mutual of Omaha and other corporations.

The next part of the pathway incorporates the Legacy Wealth Initiative.  Over 1,000 Omahans have been introduced to the Legacy Wealth approach.  300 have participated in one day intensives and 50 have graduated from the Legacy Wealth cohort.  The graduates have increased their savings, reduced debt, purchased homes, started or purchased businesses and launched a collective investment fund that will allow them to purchase and invest in real estate.  This proposal seeks to serve 500 additional cohort members and generate a $1,000,000 collective investment fund that can be matched by members and other contributors.  This will allow North Omaha residents to participate in the development occurring.  The fund will be limited to cohort members and North Omaha residents.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Empowerment Network has conducted polls, research, surveys and door-to-door outreach to identify and confirm needs in the community.  Over 8,000 have participated over the past 15 years, sharing their ideas, issues, recommendations, suggestions, priorities through these various means.  Prior to the pandemic, the community was making measurable progress in 8 of 10 areas they had helped to prioritize.  

With the impact of the pandemic, many of the trends were reversed or halted.  Now, as we begin moving forward again, the community is once again making progress.  The needs identified in the visioning workshop and other meetings confirm what the Network has gathered over the years. 

The community has identified the need for:  more jobs at higher wages, stronger business districts, investing in businesses that create jobs in the community, using African-American culture to create experiences that generate economic activity that can be circulated in the community and preparing youth and adults to attain positions with higher wages and in emerging fields.

The strategies outlined in the Empowerment Network’s proposal tackles each of these with innovative strategies that have been proven to work and builds capacity within the community to prove the case for greater investment from local and national sources.

The Empowerment Network’s proposal has four primary components that build on our past and current work:

Connecting youth and adults to the workforce and advancing careers/building wealth
Creating safe and thriving communities through collaborative partnerships and capacity-building within the community
Generating tourism and creating economic engines by investing in arts, culture and entertainment
Creating the long-term infrastructure for North Omaha to lead and guide itself.  We have worked for over a decade for North Omaha to not only be at the decision-making table, but lead with the development, implementation and evaluation of projects and initiatives.
The Empowerment Network incorporates and will directly address creating a sustainable community by connecting North Omaha residents to jobs, assisting with advancement in their careers to generate higher wages and achieve decision-making positions; building infrastructure by investing in 24th and Lake and other corridors; improving quality of life by reducing gun violence and connecting residents to services and resources needed for them to empower themselves; and, changing the way business is conducted in Omaha by using African-American and North Omaha talent to lead the way with financial management and evaluation.

The second major component in the proposal is to continue building community capacity to reduce gun violence and create safe, thriving and just communities.  Research shows that communities where gun violence has been drastically reduced are able to secure higher levels of private investments.  Since the inception of Omaha 360 and community partnerships, gun violence has been decreased by 70% overall and as much as 80% in North Omaha during summer months.  These reductions in violence have helped to fuel economic investments.  Prior to the pandemic, the Omaha homicide rate reached 40 year lows.  This proposal seeks to support the expansion of Omaha 360 partnership initiatives over the next four years by investing in neighborhoods, faith-based ministries and violence prevention and intervention groups that address root causes.  Some research estimate that one homicide has a million dollar impact on the community.  By reducing homicides from average number of homicides from 40 to 25 in the past 10 years prior to the pandemic, has saved Omaha in excess of $15 million annually.  To further reduce homicides by an average of 10 through direct intervention will help Omaha save over $40 million over a four year period.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Empowerment Network’s proposal also directly aligns with the priorities identified in LB 1024.  The Network team fully understands that the community cannot “social program its way out of the conditions” which have been generated by disinvestment over the past 50 years.  Yes, there is a strong need for social programs to address the social determinants of health and the impact of the pandemic, but at this time, there’s an even stronger need for economic activities that create jobs, recruit businesses, build businesses, establish strong corridors and generate mixed-income housing that does not create displacement.  The Network team and partners are in full support of the focus on job creation, entrepreneurship, housing and creating safer and thriving communities through collaboration, capacity-building and strategic investments in the youth, families and young professionals in North Omaha.  Each component within the plan directly address these priorities with programs and strategies that have demonstrated success.  The training will prepare residents for these opportunities with strategies that have been proven to be successful.

National research highlights and the Network has demonstrated that investments in jobs will have a direct impact on reducing violence and other negative social issues.  As the Network has increased employment and partners have increased programming during summer months, gun violence in the summer was reduced by as much as 80%.  Sustaining these decreases and making them a year-round is possible with the efforts of the community partners, neighborhoods, churches and businesses.

The third component of the Pathways to Careers, Wealth and Community Ownership through Capacity-Building proposal is the expansion of the North Omaha Arts and Entertainment Collaborative.    Over 40 businesses and organizations currently partner to host events that attract as many as 5,000 to North Omaha.  The goal of this strategy is to build and expand on those events and generate tourism. In addition, venues and artists have been severely impacted by COVID-19.  These funds will not only support 24th and Lake, but venues and artists throughout North Omaha.  One of the most critical strategies to keep African-Americans in Omaha is the development of entertainment and dining options and hubs.  These funds will positively impact the economy of North Omaha and African-Americans by increasing retention of African-American professionals and recycling dollars within the North Omaha community.  Research shows that for every dollar spent on the arts, it generates a 7x return.  
For example, Christmas in the Village is now the largest holiday event in North Omaha.  The event has attracted as many as 5,000 to 24th and Lake.  Not only will these funds help to grow and expand Christmas in the Village, but help grow monthly events and programs that will build on the successes.  The Empowerment Network contracts with small businesses to fulfill and deliver services needed for the event.  With very limited budgets events like Fall Festival, Easter in the Village, the MLK Mobile Civil Rights Museum and others have attracted 500 to 1,000 families to shop, eat, learn and play in the district.  The ARPA investments will help reach the goal of attracting 100,000 visitors per year to the district and other parts of North Omaha.  Based on spending measured during Native Omaha Days, this will generate millions of dollars which will be circulated back into the North Omaha community.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The impact of the Empowerment Network’s strategy is as following:
1.	500 youth will be connected with employment and join the workforce over the next four years
2.	400 adults will be connected with hands-on job training to acquire skills needed to join the workforce generating an income that moves them beyond poverty
3.	250 will complete the Redefine the Game Institute which will assist them with gaining higher level positions paying higher wages.  These leaders will position North Omaha and African-Americans for long-term success and retention.
4.	250 North Omaha residents will complete the Legacy Wealth Initiative which will prepare them to increase savings, become homeowners, launch businesses, make collective investments with other African-Americans and North Omaha residents and transfer wealth to future generations.  The collective investment fund will allow residents to invest in the change happening in the community.  The million investment will be matched by other funding.
5.	The Omaha 360 partners including neighborhoods, churches and community partners will work together to continue reducing gun violence by 50%.  The economic impact will be in the range of $20 to $40 million. 
6.	100,000 tourists will attend events and activities in North Omaha with a primary focus on 24th and Lake and other targeted venues.  Based on research, the $2 million investment will generate $14 million in economic activity.
7.	20 additional jobs will be created by developing the North Omaha Financial Management team and investments in a North Omaha-based/African-American owned evaluation company.
The projected annual economic impact of the Pathway to Careers, Wealth and Community Ownership project will be in excess of $60 million by 2026.  More youth and adults will join the workforce generating income, current workers will receive higher wages, families will save and invest in order to transfer wealth to the next generation and tourists will visit North Omaha to shop, eat and enjoy educational and entertainment activities.

The final component of the Pathways to Careers, Wealth and Community Ownership through Capacity-Building Proposal is to create long-term sustainability by developing a structure in North Omaha to allow it to control its own destiny.  The Empowerment Network is seeking funds to create a North Omaha Financial Management Alliance and North Omaha Evaluation Fund.  With the support of ARPA funds, the Empowerment Network will work with community stakeholders, accounting firms, legal entities and evaluation experts to create the capacity for the community to manage large grants and evaluate progress.  The team believes these functions should be within the community utilizing African-American and North Omaha talent.  The Network will work with the committee to identify companies that can manage and execute this work.</p>

Residents will have more options for shopping, entertainment and services in their own neighborhoods.  Transportation will be less of a barrier because many services and employment opportunities will be within walking distance. 
The Empowerment Network will facilitate and manage the programs and subcontract specific components as identified with small businesses, organizations, neighborhoods and churches.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The final component of the Pathways to Careers, Wealth and Community Ownership through Capacity-Building Proposal is to create long-term sustainability by developing a structure in North Omaha to allow it to control its own destiny. 

The Empowerment Network is seeking funds to create a North Omaha Financial Management Alliance and North Omaha Evaluation Fund.  With the support of ARPA funds, the Empowerment Network will work with community stakeholders, accounting firms, legal entities and evaluation experts to create the capacity for the community to manage large grants and evaluate progress.  The team believes these functions should be within the community utilizing African-American and North Omaha talent.  The Network will work with the committee to identify companies that can manage and execute this work.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Step-Up Omaha is considered a best practice by the Obama Foundation.  The Omaha 360 model is identified as an evidence-based model by the Department of Justice.  The Cradle to Career strategy of the Empowerment Network has been identified by the Department of Education and Harvard University as highly rated and best practice model.   The Network collaborative approach is recognized across the country as one to be replicated.  The strategies support Project Safe Neighborhoods, Asset-based Development and successful place-based work from communities across the country. The innovation is the holistic approach which incorporates community engagement at every phase.  The Village Empowerment Center implements a successful one-stop model which reduces barriers and multiple transportation stops.  The Center has already served thousands of residents.   In addition, the center is introducing youth to STEAM through drones, robotics, sound engineering, entrepreneurship and other fields that assist them in becoming innovators, creators and producers.   Most communities consistently call on churches, pastors and neighborhood representatives to do work in the community, but very few actually compensate these groups for this work.  The Network supports making financial investments in these groups and has a track record of working together to improve neighborhoods and families. Very few historically African-American communities have Black-owned financial companies and evaluation companies leading, managing and evaluating efforts like the Omaha Recovery Program.  This proposal would make that a priority.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> We anticipate using similar measures.  The Empowerment Network is recognized for its role in working with partners to develop and implement collaborative approaches to help achieve the following outcomes and results: 1) increasing graduation rates and academic performance; 2) reducing gun and gang violence; 3) increasing the number of college graduates; 4) increasing the number of African-American owned businesses; 5) reducing unemployment and being a catalyst for economic development in North Omaha; 6) engaging thousands of residents in specific strategies to improve their community; 7) recruiting mentors and partner agencies to work with youth in schools; 8) building the capacity of neighborhood organizations and other non-profits; 9) providing data and research to assist with informed decision-making; 10) and, creating leadership development programs for corporate and non-profit employees.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The goals and outcomes identified within this proposal will be measured and evaluated by an African-American/North Omaha led organization.   In the past, the Empowerment Network with the assistance of the University of Nebraska-Omaha Research Department, OPS and State of Nebraska and Creighton University have documented measurable successes. This proposal will take the measurement to another level through formal evaluations conducted by leading researchers.  While this project is being implemented, the team will continue to use the data and outcomes to generate local and national resources.The team has also worked with Creighton University professors.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Youth and adults will receive training required to enter the workforce in areas of high need.  Participants in Redefine the Game and Legacy Wealth will increase wages, improve financial management skills and create investment opportunities.  Community members will be able to participate in the development happening in North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> The Empowerment Network is well-known for its partnerships.  The Network will build on and expand partnerships with over 200 organizations, ministries, businesses and neighborhoods.  The Network subcontracts with these organizations and works through MOU’s when financial resources are involved.  As outlined, these partnerships include small businesses, artists, contractors, entertainers, neighborhood associations and groups, venues within core districts in North Omaha, youth development agencies and others. Step-Up Omaha for example includes partnerships with the City of Omaha, Lakin Foundation, Urban League, Hope Center for Kids, Boys and Girls Clubs, PACE, OPS, MCC and others. Omaha 360 includes partnerships with well over 500 participants including community-based organizations, neighborhoods, churches, law enforcement, educators, health systems and small businesses. The Village at 24th and Lake incorporates over 40 businesses, venues and organizations. Christmas in the Village involves as many as 100 businesses, organizations, vendors, artists and service providers. Redefine the Game has garnered participation from 40+ corporations, businesses, governmental agencies and non-profit organizations.  The Transformation 2025 initiative includes many of these players and CEO’s and Executive Level leaders from major corporations and organizations throughout Omaha and the state of Nebraska.</p>
