Our goal is to provide accurate information so the community can make the best-informed decisions for their mental and physical health. We will continue to bring in politicians, health, and business professionals who oversee policies, that bring a clear assessment to the local community. Moreover, every Friday we broadcast Douglas County health department information for our current COVID-19 assessment levels and other local health concerns.

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> 1.	To respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative impacts.

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> To respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative impacts;
Since, March 2020 we created a Health show, created PSAs, interviewed, and broadcasted Covid-19 pandemic related information daily. The funding will be used for the same purposes however, we will be able to expand our coverage to the most vulnerable:
1.	COVID-19 coverage that prioritizes the health care workers and change-makers on the front lines of the pandemic.
2.	COVID-19 broadcasting through our radio mechanisms regarding local pandemic issues in Omaha.
3.	COVID-19 emergency access to City, County & State health officials, politicians, hospitals, educators & employers.
4.	COVID-19 ad development & broadcasting of awareness campaigns, focused on minority testing and vaccines.
5.	COVID-19 National Security “Essential Critical Infrastructure” and National Emergency Alert System.
6.	COVID-19 Douglas County Health Show focus on community mental and physical health.
However, our main function is the safety of the Omaha people in all QCT’s. Also, MKC is a part of the COVID-19 “Essential Critical Infrastructure” National Security Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system delivers critical warnings and information out to the public on broadcast radio and their wireless devices. Participation by wireless providers is voluntary, but those that offer the service must adhere to the technical and operational requirements established by the FCC. Authorized public safety officials send the alerts through FEMA's Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) to wireless providers, which then push the alerts from cell towers to mobile devices in the affected area.</p>
