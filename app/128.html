  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 8279000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 2279000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> TC Accommodator 160, LLC, is owned by White Lotus Group ("WLG), located off I-480's Martha Street Exit, 2711 Martha Street ("Project").  The Project includes a mixed use facility including storage and  main level retail presence.  

The Project has been designed, and will bring a unique entry to a hopeful revival of the Sheelytown district that recently lost its funding.  Additional challenges related to the brownfield nature of site, will allow that entry to Sheelytown to be introduced with a new presence.

The Project has already been engineered, including efforts to work with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for remediation and monitoring of vapor intrusion.  Housing is not recommended at the site, and the Project represents the highest and best for the site given covenant restrictions and environmental concerns.

Integrating industrial uses above grade with a retail main level will introduce an achievable project and solve as a pathway for increased investment to the neighborhood.

Construction would begin in 2023 and conclude in 2024 with a high degree of confidence.</p>

  <p> The site has environmental challenges as well as deed restrictions.  With its high visibility location, investment into the site will serve as a catalyst to additional investment in the neighborhood.  There are no known sources of incentive dollars to address the environmental and site challenges while building something that would augment investment.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Grant funds will specifically be used to address environmental challenges, create a renewable energy system and upgrade the exterior facade to meet the objectives of the project.</p>

  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Our firm has a CPA/Controller that works with our engineering and construction management staff. Upon updating engineering with city of omaha public works approvals and bonding, a general construction contract alongside engineering and marketing fees defined, we would see to submit payment applications with associated lien waivers (approved by 3rd party engineer) for payment or reimbursement. That would continue until final pay application and payment.</p>
