  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Greenslate aims to build a 200K square foot industrial building at 5902 N 9th street.  This project will bring hundreds of new jobs to this area.  Greenslate is also looking to locate it's own subsidiary manufacturing business called Wild Pack to this location.  We will be ready to break ground in the spring of 2023 and we expect the project to take 12 months to complete.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> We are in the design of the building currently.  We expect to commence ground work on the project later this fall with permits and construction start projected for the spring of 2023.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> Create job and tax base</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> By constructing a new 200K square foot state of the art industrial facility in this location, we will be bringing new businesses to the building which we expect will bring with them over 200 good paying jobs.  The creation of these job will bring opportunity to this section of Northeast Omaha.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposal to build a 200K square foot industrial space on vacant land means there will be no displacement.  We will both activate a long since vacant 11 acre parcel of ground, but we will create hundreds of workforce/industry jobs in the community, for the community and hopefully by the community which would give the economic investment a great chance for recycling through the broader northeast Omaha community as a whole.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The project will bring job creation, utilization of vacant land, create tax base, and avoid displacement in the community.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We expect there to be over 200 permanent jobs created with this project when completed.  We expect these jobs will be 40K per year jobs and above.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 200+</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> We expect a maximum of 50 people on site for the construction of the project</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> We expect wages at 20.00 per hour and above</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> First, the project work would be made available to northeast Omaha based subcontractors for bidding all any and all applicable and eligible trades.  Our hope is that locally grown industry will have an opportunity to locate and grow jobs within this facility.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> This project would activate a long vacant 11 acre parcel of ground and bring good paying jobs with it, which will recycle through the community a number of ways including patronage of local businesses and services, housing and tax base.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The project will have a very purposeful water detention program leaving a good amount of greenspace for nature and water permeation.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The project itself will be a beacon of where innovation and new concept makers can find a respite to do their work.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Our primary goal with the project is the creation of high wage job opportunities.  This project will not be all things for the community, but bringing good wage paying jobs will create a very strong bedrock for economic recycling through the community and the organic growth that comes as a result.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> I think the outcomes of job creation and tax base are easily measured through property tax payments and simply visiting the finished project to see the parking lot full of cars and the building alive with activity.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> I think anytime you bring 200 jobs to an area you are a catalyst for further investment.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The request level is to help offset costs which in turn lowers the amount of equity required which lowers the amount of net income needed to satisfy a market return and thus provides for more affordable rent and the attraction of the space for enterprise.</p>

  <p> The funds will be used directly for construction costs.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Bank financing, ownership equity, tax increment financing.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> In the next 60 days</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> No, we will figure out how to build the project with or without the ARPA funds but the ability to make the space more affordable is attractive to the overall objectives of the project.</p>
