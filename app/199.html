  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Create an Entrepreneur Ecosystem for the trade industry by providing affordable industrial space and housing. Offering affordable space for small business owners and affordable housing for their workforce creates employment and economic opportunities. It will create new jobs with meaningful wages that benefit the community economically. The proposal will continue to recycle supporting entrepreneurs and entrants into the trade industries. It can be scaled and replicated in multiple areas. 

Building basic infrastructure is the first step to ensure future growth and training of local workforce. The local trade industry desperately needs qualified, skilled craft professionals. Trade entrepreneurs often find a large amount of capital going towards leasing suitable space. The proposal can help free up capital to invest in talent acquisition. The trade industry must do more to effectively recruit younger workers. It’s important to develop a robust marketing campaign to attract the next generation of qualified workers who may not know about the opportunities that exist in the industry. This means tailoring recruitment techniques and outreach strategies to include incentives that the next generation actually wants. 
The proposed commercial flex building will accommodate eight trade entrepreneurs. Providing affordable space allows for greater investment in attracting and building strong workforce apprenticeship programs. Offering affordable housing to apprentices gives employers an edge in this tightening labor market. The proposed 32-unit affordable housing built near the commercial space, attracts a younger workforce. To be eligible for housing, the participant must be actively enrolled in a trade apprenticeship program. Providing this as a community resource promotes career pathways while decreasing labor shortages. This is not a new concept; Henry Ford created a similar program in the early 1900’s with great success.

Two sites have been identified; both sites will accommodate the industrial space as well as housing. Both sites are in the Qualified Census Tracts (QCT), one is in north Omaha, and one is in south Omaha. Site analysis is underway to determine optimization.</p>
