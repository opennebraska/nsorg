  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Culxr House exists in an underserved area, in the neighborhoods of North Omaha, where public benefit corporations attempt to answer a spectrum of needs in relation to these target demographics. Arts and Culture services and opportunities are scant or inaccessible to them, thereby contributing to the brain drain recognized throughout the metropolitan area. Culxr House economic proposal addresses these issues by primarily offering a platform for artists, creatives, and entrepreneurs to develop their brand. Just as important, it offers a plan for  transformational urban development. Phase One of this grant would give North Omaha artists and entrepreneurs access to subject matter experts and resources developed with Culxr House, while helping cover capacity building for operations and programs, such as education and community functions (taking place in 2023). This includes the purchase of three adjacent lots at 3014 N 24th Street, 3012 N 24th Street, and 2414 Binney Street, and for facility improvements at 3014 N 24th Street, which is the main premises for nonprofit activity. During Phase Two, improvements at 3012 N 24th Streets will transform the space into a pizza shop run by a jobs program managed by Culxr House, after the permitting process is complete. The adjacent alley will be vacated in tandem, to allow for outdoor dining and seating, and will only be open for pedestrian traffic. Phase Three begins the planning for affordable housing with mixed-use at 2414 N 24th Street in 2023. Phase Four sees funding for the construction of the affordable housing project in 2024, and for Culxr House operations and programs to continue our mission that same year. Phase Five will encompass the planning and the purchase of property at 3006 N 24th Street for a redevelopment project for the North 24th Street corridor. This property houses four bay areas and will conform to the Forever North Strategy adopted by the City of Omaha, and the location will undergo facility improvements to meet compliance and zoning codes, and as prescribed by LB1024.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Culxr House uses the space and offers services for education and skill-building, and holds forums for civic engagement. The vacation of the alley will allow for civic use, like outdoor meetings, gatherings, and dining. The North Omaha Trail is 2 blocks away, as is the Binney Street bridge over U.S. Route 75. This project proposal aims to support the N 24th Business Improvement District by improving the financial capability of Culxr House in the form of ownership transfer of property, which will allow the nonprofit and businesses to directly pay for the BID assements. The overall proposal will incoporate mixed use and affordable housing at 2414 Binney Street, and imrpve safety in this focus area for pedestrian traffic. A primary objective for Culxr House is context-sensitive education through the cultural economic training program. The present proposal greatly enhances the education and workforce training capabilities for the organization.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The project address the insufficient infrastructure issue by prioritizing improvements of building and redevelopment construction. This development fits within the cultural context because the primary organization, Culxr House, was founded in the North 24th Street corridor.
