  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Grand Theater consists of 2 buildings located at 2920 N 16th St which is owned by Mount Vernon Church and 2922 N 16th Street which is owned by an entity controlled by Lawrence Butler. The current building being considered for LB1024 funds is 2922, N 16th Street is a single story brick building storefront that is approximately 2300SF. It is a shell and interior demolition has been partially done. The building is a Local Landmark per Omaha Ordinance. The goal is to continue to build a sustainable community along 16th street and maintain its commercial building stock and allow this being to be used as office space for below market rent. All zoning variances have been applied for and approved and the building permit was issued on 4-6-2022 by the City of Omaha and last for 30 months after issuance. If funding is considered for this landmark project, the projected schedule is 6 months.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Once funds are awarded, the project is scheduled for a 6 month completion. All building permits and zoning waivers have been applied for and approved.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The renovation of the Grand Theater North building at 2922, N 16th St supports a sustainable community by recognizing the importance of keeping historic buildings and districts intact rather then demolishing them. The 16th and Locust is one of Omaha’s oldest commercial districts and should be a strong candidate for the National Register of Historic Places as a commercial district based on the North Omaha Reconnaissance Survey done in 2016. We believe what is remaining of the 16th and Locust Commercial District which is located on 16th street between approximately Binney Street to the north and Corby street to the south should be recognized as a Historic District. Renovating the building and using it as office space for businesses in the North Omaha area will hopefully draw attention to this area and continue the work of restoring 16th Street builidings.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We believe the renovation of the Grand Theater North Building aligns with the following:
Land Use. - Restoring Vacant Building that also has historic significance
Strategic Development of vacant building along 16th Street to connect downtown Corridor 
Creates innovative opportunities by providing Solar Panels on Rooftop with batteries of older buildings and making them energy independent. 
Creates beautiful landscaping and exterior lighting areas to promote walking areas.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Grand Theater North is in Census Tract 12.00, which is a qualified Census Tract. This will also offer below market rate office space to small businesses and give preference to business that provide service to North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> It is estimated that a part time general labor position will be needed and 60 construction jobs will be created. The anticipated renovation payroll is between $300,000 and $400,000. It is estimated that and office building with 12 part time positions will result from this renovation at an estimated wage of $20.00/hour.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We will provide below market rents for office space</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Grand Theater North is another Historic commercial building that will saved and redeveloped to an adaptive use along 16th Street. This is in conjunction with a National Register of Historic Places property building to west, The Allas Apartments, landscaping and exterior lighting will provide areas where people can walk and gather.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This promotes community sustainability by not demolishing old and dilapidated buildings but promoting adaptive use of buildings like this to rebuilt trust among communities and leaders.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Instead of demolishing old buildings, not only will this be redeveloped but will use 50% of electrical energy from solar power with 43 panels and an 8 hour battery. It can be a beacon that the Solar tax Credit can bring great value to older buildings in need of substancial renovation.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Further development along N. 16th Street area. It is similar to midtown Farnam street where older buildings combined with newer buildings to make this desirable.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The measurement can be seen 10 years from now by the City of Omaha and other developers is other buildings are being constructed and/or renovated.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> I believe this development along with the Allas Apartments next door would provide visual evidence to other developers that 16th street is ready</p>
