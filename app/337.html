  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> EADAN Community and Cultural Center Capital Improvement Project and Programming Support for Housing Security, Food Security (EADAN Family Food Pantry) Job Replacement Assistance and Youth Mentoring, Afterschool Program and Gang Prevention Programs for East African Immigrants in Omaha</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 1300000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 1300000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> EADAN AND AL HUDA ISLAMIC CENTER have a unique opportunity to create a resource for the community.  Al Huda Islamic Center owns the building/property where EADAN holds a long-term lease for its office space. The property which is located at 4735 N.W. Radial Hwy is adjacent to a qualified census track and serves low-income minorities who live in the qualified census tracks. This building is zoned as general commercial.
  
Our plan is to renovate the currently unused space in the basement of the building to create a community and cultural center, which would provide space for a large community room, equipped with high speed broad band, which would be utilized for our youth mentoring, anti-gang and after school programs as well as adult educational programs and available to the community at large.  In addition, EADAN plans to finish a space for a women’s gym, also a meeting room for women where they can speak and meet freely.  We would also create a funeral room, where members of the community can prepare loved ones that have died for viewing and burial, as funeral homes charge at least $8,000 for these services. We would add bathrooms and shower facilities into this area as well.    In addition we would have a secure storage area for our pantry, and a culture museum of sorts to celebrate our heritage. Also a kitchenette for preping and  cleaning up food for events and also for the USDA free and reduced lunch program.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Award of Funds - November 2022. Plans and details for this project should be able to be completed very quickly, it about a month.  Interior construction to start in February, 2023 - interior construction completed in May of 2023.  Landscape and hardscape for the courtyard would occur over the winter and then installed in May or June of 2023.  New parking lot  construction September of 2023.  This capital improvement portion of the project will take four months from start to finish.  We would like to have the work completed from February – May in 2023 so that EADAN is ready for students next summer.  We would like all of the landscaping elements of the project to be completed in the Spring as well.

The parking lot could be completed in a third phase, starting and finishing in September 2023.
Scope of work to convert this unused space into a beautiful gathering spot for the community. Cost Estimate attached includes the following line items:
framing, drywalling, door installations, adding drop ceilings, electrical, plumbing for bathrooms, parking lots and excavation of a new entrance for the community center.  Program Support will continue once funds are received and continue with this funding for 2 years.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The East African Immigrants that we serve need a space to meet, they have no where else to go. :  Many organizations in Omaha have received assistance through United Way of the Midlands and Omaha Community Foundation for ARAP funding.  EADAN did not receive any of of those funds, despite applying.  We are still seeing a great deal of economic, social and public health turmoil with in the immigrant community.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project aligns with the needs identified in the vision sessions looking for Community Meeting Space.  

This community  and cultural center will be open to anyone that would like to use it, not just East African Immigrants. Exterior improvements will help improve perceptions of the area. Improvement of infrastructure including sidewalks, and broadband access within the community and cultural center.  EADAN provides mentoring  and anti-gang services to the East African Youth in Omaha.
EADAN is also helping to address the issue of jobs by providing some jobs but larger is helping our families find new and better replacement jobs.
This project will improve the lives of everyone.  People feel better and safer in areas that are well maintained or revitalized.</p>
