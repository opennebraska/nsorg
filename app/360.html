  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Compete Technologies supports Compete Institute of Socioeconomic Policy and Education with predictive analytics.  By providing predictive models to be used in trainings and community projects for the Department of Health and Human Services, Nebraska Children's Foundation, Bring Up Nebraska, and the Anne E. Casey Foundation, we remove systemic barriers which are perpetuated by traditionally quantitative data drive ideology.  It is essential to train a workforce to expand the development and implementation of culturally responsible data analytics and maintenance.</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Compete Technologies provides predictive analytics with emphasis on the qualitative component that is Lived Experience.  Lived Experience is the essential missing link in the gaps of conventional data collected in the systems of juvenile justice, education, Child Welfare, and housing.  Disparities and overrepresentation of people of Color exist simply because there are no people of Color directing and informing the data collection process.  Unfamiliarity and implicit bias perpetuate the worsening conditions of Black families in Omaha, Nebraska.

Compete Technologies makes technology and specifically data exploration palatable and accessible to those who are most impacted in an attempt to provide a social awareness which impels to action.  The Data Science Academy will provide a direct pathway for those most proximal to disparities to develop culturally responsive evidence based models, learn how to collect, interpret, and manipulate data, and also provide skills that are in high demand in high paying careers.   The Data Science Academy will grow students as interns to become instructors and therefore create careers.  Through strategic partnerships with Bellevue University, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and Creighton University, participants will be encouraged to continue their education at a 4 year institution.  

Through a partnership with workforce development, tuition will be covered for those most impacted.</p>
