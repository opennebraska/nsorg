  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our program will create a sustainable community and improve the quality of life through our services. Currently, there is not a trauma program in the North Omaha Community that provides trauma therapy or interventions for youth and families. The current solution is the involvement of the Juvenile Justice System. This is not a solution for a community or a family. The involvement of the Juvenile Justice System to solve the problem of trauma (childhood trauma, intergenerational/transgenerational trauma) creates an unsafe and unsustainable community. The involvement of the Juvenile Justice System to solve this problem is one of the factors that create the prison pipeline for youth of color. These are the following factors that create unsustainability and poor quality of life in the North Omaha Community:
	At-risk youth are more at risk today creating an unsafe community in North Omaha. Currently, there is an increase in gun violence among gangs and youth. That create an image that our community is not safe.
	Families that have intergenerational trauma are also stuck in a lower socioeconomic class and some of these families have been on welfare for generations. Because of intergenerational trauma, youth and families cannot break the welfare cycle. This stops the creation of generational wealth in families of the North Omaha Community. 
	80% of the youth in Douglas County Corrections are youth of color. Because of the rates of the youth of color in Douglas County Youth Center, this affects the quality of life and stops the growth of generational wealth in the family. 
The quality of life for youth and families is poor and one of the factors is trauma. Because of trauma, the youth’s decision-making is poor which affects the quality of life in our community. Families that have intergenerational trauma are stuck in poverty (welfare or lower-paying jobs) and it is difficult for them to break the cycle of poor quality of life. We see this through violence, not taking care of our community (throwing out trash from moving vehicles, vandalism, property crimes, violence, despair, and the lack of human connection throughout the North Omaha Community). This affects our community by turning away investors and stopping job creation.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Visionary Workshop provided the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat) analysis. Our company will address the following findings from the SWOT analysis:
Weakness	
Lack of community cohesiveness and cohesion	By treating the trauma families and youth will have more trust in others and begin to connect with the community.
Lack of Black-owned companies	We are a Black Owned Company
Lack of jobs.	Our company will create 7 jobs at the median income level.
Lack of profit jobs.	We are a for-profit company.
Threats	
Media, in particular, focuses on violence, and negative human interactions, in North Omaha	Our program will begin to provide programming to address trauma in youth and families that will create better outcomes for the family and community.
Lack of integrity	Providing programming for intergenerational trauma will increase the integrity in the family and the community.
Overall lack of hopelessness	Our company will be a place will families on the Northside can get help for their young people.
Access to health care	North Omaha families will not have to go out west of 72nd seeking emotional/mental health for the adolescents. We will be located on the North Side and are a black-owned business.

A specific gap that will be addressed is the lack of trauma programming in our community. A second gap is the lack of specific therapy for youth that is in the early stages of a crisis. Our parents on the Northside are seeking help with youth that are acting out, they cannot locate help. The result of not having help is eventually the Juvenile Justice System becomes involved and this is not a solution. Our company will address this specific gap.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The goal of the funding is that it must be transformational, fundamental change, and long-lasting economic growth. The creation of our program and working with the families in our communities will begin to change and transform the behavioral actions of the youth and families. The fundamental change will be the perception of North Omaha. Our business will be located on 24th and Miami, where youth and families can find us. Long-lasting economic growth will begin to happen in families that have been affected by intergenerational trauma through therapy and intervention. The creation of trauma will begin to change families that have been trapped in the welfare cycle for generations. Our business will create seven jobs that will be in the middle-class economic range. These seven jobs are entry-level jobs and the beginning of economic growth and economic wealth.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> This business will create nine permanent jobs in North Omaha. Five of the jobs will only require a high school diploma. The wage level of four of the jobs will be $30,000 - $35,000 range. One job will be (secretary) $25,000 - $30,000 range. There will be two jobs that are created in the $ 50,000-a-year range. Our business will contract with two therapists and one yoga instructor. Seven of the jobs will be filled with individuals from the qualified Census Tract (16th street, East/52nd street, West/Forest Lawn Ave, North/Cummings, South). The people will live in this area.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The goal of the funding is that it must be transformational, fundamental change, and long-lasting economic growth. The creation of our program and working with the families in our communities will begin to change and transform the behavioral actions of the youth and families. The fundamental change will be the perception of North Omaha. Our business will be located on 24th and Miami, where youth and families can find us. Long-lasting economic growth will begin to happen in families that have been affected by intergenerational trauma through therapy and intervention. The creation of a trauma program will begin to change families that have been trapped in the welfare cycle for generations. Our business will create seven jobs that will be in the middle-class economic range. These seven jobs are entry-level jobs and the beginning of economic growth and economic wealth.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The benefits to the community will be jobs that are not connected to general labor (construction, waste management, fast food, restaurant, gas station, or retail stores). The income will not be a minimum wage of $9.00 or entry-level at $12.00 an hour. The benefit to the community is that these jobs will be viewed as more professional, the business will make positive impacts on the people in the community, and could be a path for employees continuing their education, There will be a fundamental change in our community, creating safety and improved health care, and long-lasting economic growth. The quality of life in the community will be improved by the business being a trauma program, there is not a program like this in the North Omaha community. This business will create improved economic stability for 9 people and because this is an innovative business there might be future training in our facility.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal will contribute to nine families improving their quality of life and they will be employed on 24th street which will bring economic life back into the North Omaha Community.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> This business is one of a kind. There is no trauma program that will provide interventions to the youth and families on the Northside. Most of the programs or therapy that is sought is further out in West Omaha. Our business is innovative, will create jobs in our community, and improve the quality of life of families in our community. We will work with the UNO Omaha Spatial Justice Project to develop a statistical analysis to verify the effectiveness of our business.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> This business will create seven jobs in our community at the median income range. The employees will live in the qualified census track area, their quality of life will be improved economically, and the employees might continue with secondary education, this will begin the process of generational wealth. The business will also create a safer community by providing trauma therapy and interventions to at-risk youth and families. The problem the business will solve is that despite the current services and programs in our community youth are becoming more and more at risk. The unique product we offer addresses the issues of complex trauma in urban families in order to affect sustainable outcomes of change. The vision for our community is to foster generations of power, influence, and change.</p>
