  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition (NUIHC) has been serving the urban Indian community in Omaha since 1986. Our mission is to elevate the health status of Urban Indians and other underserved populations. We address health disparities through education, collaboration, advocacy and health service delivery. 

Years in the making, we recently completed the building of our Eagle Heights Campus in South Omaha. Altogether a $16 million dollar project, this included a 44-unit Affordable Housing Project and our Services Building. This has been a huge goal for NUIHC to further our transformative efforts in the Native community.

●	In 2020, we completed our Eagle Heights Affordable Housing project. Located at 4834 S 23rd Street in historic South Omaha, Eagle Heights is a 44-unit building funded through tax credits. 

The goal of this project was to transform the lives of our community members by providing expansion of social services in combination with the addition of NUIHC Services Building across the street. In partnership with the City of Omaha, we developed and implemented the Ready to Rent Program, an adult learning classroom inspired principle in housing readiness education to prepare future applicants for EH housing and beyond.

●	In 2022, we completed the renovation of the NUIHC Services Building. Located at 2226 N Street, we offer inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment,   health clinic, youth and elder programs. The renovation was funded through various generous local foundations.  
	
This proposal would take us one step further in our efforts to advocate for the Native Community.</p>

  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> Fry Bread on Wheels</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 623600.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 623600.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> We acknowledge that Omaha is the traditional land of the Umoⁿhoⁿ people. We honor the Indigenous people of America, all elders; past, present, and emerging. We are called on to learn and share what we learn about the tribal history, culture, and contributions that have been suppressed in telling the story of America.

There are no Native restaurants in Omaha. There are no Native food trucks in Omaha. If you are lucky, you know folks in the community and will hear through word of mouth that someone’s auntie is making Indian tacos, corn soup, Indian burgers and fry bread and can taste what home feels like to our Native brothers, sisters, cousins, aunties, uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers.

We are still here. Representation matters. Opportunities are needed.

We propose to offer job training and gainful employment opportunities to our clients who successfully complete substance abuse residential and/or outpatient treatment. We are requesting funds to purchase and operate a food truck, work with Metro Community College to offer short order cook training and offer gainful employment opportunities working in our Native food truck.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Based on grant award in January-February of 2023, we anticipate project completion by end of June 2023. See attached project timeline.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our proposed Native Food Truck would allow us to enhance the services we provide to our clients by providing them with education, job experience and gainful employment. All profits from the food truck would go back into the organization to allow us to continue to offer transformational programs and services to our community.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> There is a lack of diversity in the census tracks in South Omaha. Fry Bread on Wheels will offer a distinct selection of traditional foods associated with the Native American Community.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Transformational: There are no Native restaurants in Omaha. There are no Native food trucks in Omaha. If you are lucky, you know folks in the community and will hear through word of mouth that someone’s auntie is making Indian tacos, Indian burgers and fry bread and can taste what home feels like to our Native brothers, sisters, cousins, aunties, uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers.

We are still here. Representation matters. Opportunities are needed.

This would be transformational for the Native American community to be represented. It would be transformational for the clients that go through our treatment program to be offered educational and job opportunities. The profits of the food truck service would be transformational to NUIHC as it would be funding desperately needed for our programming and services offered to the community.

Long-Lasting Economic Growth: We would be able to offer gainful employment opportunities to the clients we serve. We would engage local businesses to source the equipment, supplies and produce necessary to run the business.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We anticipate creating four (4) short order cook positions with an entry level salary of $20/hour plus benefits.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Four (4)</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Entry Level salary of $20/hour plus benefits.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We would seek to hire local participants who reside within the Qualified Census Tracts.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Communities benefit from full-time employment. We would be helping to bridge the gap in the food disparity need in South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> By providing educational and gainful employment opportunities as well as helping fund NUIHC's other programming and services offered to the community.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> This will be the only Native food truck in the city and likely surrounding areas to our knowledge. This is innovative in the way of providing education and employment opportunities for folks getting back on their feet.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> We'll be providing education opportunities. This can be a model to inspire other non-profits to provide a similar service to their constituents.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> We plan to monitor the operational costs which would be limited to food supplies, gas and personnel. Mobile Food Services (North American Industry Classification System or NAICS 72233) tracks and measures Food Truck businesses in the United States. A food truck is considered a high profit food business idea, mainly because it involves a much lower investment as against a sit-down restaurant.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> We would partner with Metro Community College for their short order cook training. We would also partner with No More Empty Pots related to food acquisitions.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> We are in discussions with No More Empty Pots and Metro Community College Culinary Arts Program.</p>

  <h3>Displacement</h3>
