  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> N3WDOOM Inc. is a united collective that consists of an alliance between community members, local entrepreneurs, and nonprofits, culminating in a synergy that flips the status quo by creating opportunities for Black and Brown community healing via self-expression, educational advancement, and professional development. 

Since 2020, we have successfully hosted and organized music events,  art shows with live paintings and leading to the release of the N3WDOOM “Zine”  which highlights healing artistic expressions through community representation. 
N3WDOOM  has since grown its scope of focus to developing educational programs that help bridge the gap caused by systemic racism and prejudice on the Black community. The COVID era has shine a light on regarding racism and its role in shaping Omaha dating back prior to Will Brown’s murder on judicial grounds in 1919.

We strive to establish a new paradigm in rejecting the systemic societal norms that have restricted the advancement of Black and Brown residents for generations, such as through our Return to Citizenship program providing professional development opportunities for recently incarcerated individuals.  

During the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020, we offered classes online. The most recent class series consisted of six meetings over a time period spanning 12 weeks. We received great feedback and establish over 16 different businesses and entities in support of Omaha’s entrepreneurship in the Black and Brown community. That list is ever-growing with additional groups underway, including multiple nonprofits and even facilitating the setup of our first school. 
Due to COVID we offered our classes online with the last series providing six meetings every other week spanning 12 weeks. We had great feedback and participation. Thanks to the community response, the next cohort starts October 16th, 2022 with additional courses and expanded coursework to support enrollment which has doubled since last fall. 

With COVID subsiding, the community is eager for N3WDOOM Inc to establish a Community center for in-person classes. This will improve accessibility for those with limited or unreliable access to computers and the internet. 
We are currently in the early stages of planning N3WDOOM’s annual Youth Summer Breakfast Program, starting June-August 2023, to provide breakfast  3 days a week for 6 weeks spanning summer break. The meals will be prepared by various catering companies within or network of local businesses, rotating weekly with volunteers and potential interns from the workplace development program.
Lastly, we have fostered a partnership with a school in Ghana. We have recently finished the process of creating/donating crosswalk flags for students who have to cross a deadly busy intersection on their commute to school. This is one of our many important partnerships that expands outside of our immediate community while striving to make the world a little bit more accessible.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment will allocate the grant funds to obtain a community resource center for in-person trainings, mentorship meetings, workshops, and internships in addition to establishing a Resale Store supplied and operated by the community it serves.

The Center of Empowerment will consist of office spaces, classrooms, a store for donated secondhand goods, and a community professional development space, providing access to stable internet for all participants seeking gainful employment and/or support with business plan development. 

At N3WDOOM Inc. our motto is to “turn individuals into assets”, helping them understand their greatest treasure in life is the choice of how to spend it. We will be a driving force of economic growth by fostering entrepreneurship in the Black and Brown community, leading to job creation and generational enhancement.
This resource center will be the number one asset for our workforce development programs where recently incarcerated individuals come for community advocacy and take the initial steps to “Return to Citizenship”. Outside of providing resources and employment opportunities for all our participants, the N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment will cultivate a safe space with special attention towards mental health resources and skill development through partnerships. 

Some of the annual programs offered through the Center are workshops focused on Problem-Solving, Communication Skills Development, Life Beyond School, Life Beyond Incarceration, and Financial Literacy, to name a few.  Childcare stipends for accommodations will be available for participants during classes to help close the gender-disparity gap for female entrepreneurship. Additionally, the Center of Empowerment will house a retail space for secondhand goods cycled through the community. Participants in the education, professional and personal development courses will be rewarded with non-fungible tokens through N3WDOOM Inc. that allows them to purchase household necessities by choosing to spend their time investing in themselves. Excess overstock will become a revenue stream sold internationally to business partners in Africa creating revenue with international partnerships.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We believe our organization's mission and programs are exactly what many communities across the county need to address the race-based economic gap on a larger scale and are proud to establish the start of this process in Omaha. The Visioning Workshop provided key perspectives through the voice of the engaged community at large that were highlighted throughout COVID-19. The initial steps for favorable community advancement in overcoming the deficits indicated by the Visioning Workshop will be to provide assistance supporting local entrepreneurs in the creation of small businesses. Our educational courses will cover a wide range of subjects, our Educators Union will foster mentorships and our second-hand resale store will create employment opportunities for the community. 

The N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment provides a new grassroots form of unorthodox education applicable to life outside of the public school system. One way the participants in our programs receive instant personal gain from completing a course is through receiving N3WDOOM tokens (called Doom Dollars / DDs) which in turn can be spent at the second-hand store, rewarding the fundamental notion that investing in themselves pays off beyond the economic limitations that were identified in the Visioning Workshop and that have historically plagued our community for generations.  Additionally, the nonprofit pledges to provide program participants with access to Chromebooks and free wifi for three consecutive years at our N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment, culminating in upwards of over 800 laptops in the hands of the underserved.

Emphasizing education centered on economics and financial literacy is the most essential component of lasting economic growth for the unsupported and under-resourced communities in Omaha. Not only will our programs save a large demographic of underserved individuals, but we will also be an intricate part in developing those individuals into future assets to their community. With opportunities and appropriate resources, we aim to foster the values that create generational wealth by facilitating the creation of general businesses through guiding and fostering the entrepreneurial spirit within North and South Omaha. 

Under the nonprofit's four pillars of programming, our courses on context-sensitive education and finance fall under the Sustainable Community category. Our resale store will be an intricate part of the business districts they reside in, enhancing Infrastructure while bringing in customers from all walks of life from across the community. The job-specific training under our workforce development programs for recently incarcerated community members will improve the quality of life for many as we provide relatable work skills that translate into upward mobility for individuals, families and the community at large. 

The strengths of South Omaha's volunteerism and strong entrepreneurship can help leverage opportunities and mentor roles of aspiring program participants looking to replicate similar business structures. The vacant buildings in North Omaha can be renovated by small business contractors using our network once our union programs are established. Our emphasis on education regarding life skills and economics will provide the necessary tools for transformation change not only in the workforce but for generations to come. These fundamental changes will not only improve the perception outside and within these communities, but they will also create a bridge to unify resources amongst both for support and collaboration, healing the race-based gap and strengthening Omaha as a whole.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment would combat job loss experienced during COVID, and foster job growth through supporting community-centered entrepreneurship initiatives. Our nonprofit, business, and services fall in the QTC communities with a large proportion of low-income residents, disproportionately impacted by the COVID pandemic. Much-needed services will include behavioral therapy, trauma recovery, job training, and education. With remote education rates going up our center will be a resource for high-speed internet.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The economic impact of the N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment will not only be measured in job creation but N3WDOOM Inc. will literally and figurately recycle wealth and resources among community members. The outline for the community center employees sits at a projected 26 staff members with an additional 10 collection crew members. These 35-plus employees will be a mix of full-time and part-time positions on the budget for an annual basis. With the intent to grow and scale out programs we anticipate these positions will increase by 10 each year. With the most recent “Nebraska Initiative 433” we aim for N3WDOOM Inc. to be a desired place of employment and strive to stay ahead of the curve, starting our part-time employee's wages in 2024 at the 2026 projection of $15 dollars per hour. Full-time employees and Adminstarions roles will be competitive compared to the market average.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Measuring the creation of jobs can be one metric, N3WDOOM Inc. and its Workforce Development Programs are centered around the scaling of each business's range and services. Not only do we aim to create jobs within those businesses we aim to help foster the network where those businesses have the necessary support to duplicate processes and linkages between businesses and service providers.  A minimum of 25 jobs will be created within N3WDOOM Inc. through the Center of Empowerment staff with an additional 10 positions created specifically for the Donations Collection team.  As a modern-day business incubator, we aim to be a catalyst for the early developmental stages of start-ups. Our goal is to connect investors, mentors, and professionals from our Educators Union and other community members within our Network to entrepreneurs, interns, and potential employees. In short, there is no limit and exactly how many jobs we help create will be endless, with a specific goal to create 50 businesses per year within a year of opening the N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment doors. This could translate into 250 different employees if each business onboards 5 employees.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> This answer is dependent on the needs of the building and property we are able to secure by the time the grant funds are available.  We have projected services for HVAC, cleaning, painting, landscaping, electrical, general contracting, plumbing, electrical, ADA compliance alterations, and other essential services. This projected budget is under $1,000,000. Not only is it highly sensible, but it would also be our honor to source local contractors directly from within our backyard, allowing for relationships to develop and creating awareness of the programs we offer that further support the community.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Our proposed minimum wage for our employees will be ahead of Initiative 433. We aim to start all our employees at a $15 dollar per hour minimum wage.  We support the idea that more money for workers means more money for local small businesses.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Community members who benefit from courses and internships offered through the N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment will have first access to employment opportunities cultivated through the small-business incubator mentorship programs. As the success of the businesses launched through N3WDOOM’s support spreads, more entrepreneurs will be attracted as well as community members seeking self-improvement to better qualify for these newly established business opportunities.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The scope of benefits the QTC 20 community will experience from the establishment of the N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment is vast, spanning our self-improvement programs via work skills development, employment opportunities, and start-up entrepreneurship support for and from individuals with similar backgrounds, obstacles, and achievements. 

From a proof of concept standpoint, not only do we plan to diversify group economics by recycling wealth within the community, we also plan to greatly improve the quality of life for many from a non-traditional educational role while doing so. 

Under our four pillars of programming, we start with the youth, as they are not only the bloodline of our community but of our nation as a whole. Our Youth Programs directed at our M.I.P.’s (Most Important People) include educational workshops on financial literacy and entrepreneurial endeavors. 

Through the structure of our Educators Union as a collective think tank, many community-wide challenges will be explored and addressed at the  N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment engaging a dialog rooted in community-sourced solutions through ongoing discourse with city-wide community leaders. 

Our Return to Citizenship programs will do exactly that, returning recently incarcerated individuals into moldable and formable citizens. Our overarching goal is to “Turn Individuals into Assets”. We’d like to think that the fallacy of rehabilitation behind bars will be synonymous with us, but with a greater impact as there are no bars, only personal commitment to self-improvement. We aim to provide resources, support, and life skills to the demographic of people who need it the most, utilizing community counselors with a program focused on communication skills, conflict resolution, and social engagement. 

The three previously stated pillars of N3WDOOM Inc. empowerment model conveniently transition individuals into the fourth pillar, our Workforce Development program, wherein business owners and nonprofits within our network looking to duplicate and/or scale their operations can be outfitted with eager, vetted, potential employees and interns. This will allow for a fit placement hiring process for businesses as well as a learning experience for potential employees.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Collectively our nonprofit will provide the community and businesses alike with key elements necessary to thrive. N3WDOOM Inc. attracts like-minded entrepreneurs and community leaders committed to improving quality of life by investing directly in the community through youth programs, professional development skill building, and generating opportunities for previously incarcerated individuals (who are disproportionately Black and Brown folks) to create a new life.  Our hope is that future generations following our programs will have a better foundation of support and intuitive direction toward entrepreneurial endeavors, helping them avoid the trap of choices that lead to incarceration.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Our model is recycled, but the strategy behind the operations of our business is innovation at its finest. The classic “drop your household goods off at the Goodwill” is obviously sustainable, as there are over 4000 satellite Goodwills worldwide, offering solid job opportunities for the elderly and individuals with disabilities.  The model is strong enough to make Goodwill Industries considered in the top 100 retailers in the United States. N3WDOOM innovation comes in the form of a built-in reward system for program participants to have access to the household items they need through receiving program-based non-fungible tokens (called DoomDollars) rather than burdening their often strained or limited financial resources. During the successful completion of the educational coursework and for each business created through the mentorship think tank, members will receive 10k in DD’s (Doom Dollars) to spend on goods and services within the network and our resale store. The community members then feel the importance of investing in themselves as a way to manifest the quality of life they need. One of the limiting factors for the community to lessen their household waste is the lack of transportation. We envision a second-hand store equipped with service vehicles to pick donations up at the household doorstep. Upfront costs will be heavy initially due to the allocation of service vehicles. Half of those vehicles will be deducted when the duplication process begins.  This Self-Sustaining Model has a Quadruple Bottom Line.  We will beat out “The Goodwill’s” model by the collection of goods alone. The marketing component will attract the masses with the FUBU Model. With support for BLM movements at an all-time high, and the support and pride for investing, and recycling in our model, the N3WDOOM Model will be exponential.  The Black and Brown community is by far the leading consumer of material goods in our nation with household goods being the leading expenditure. Sympathetic non-black community members will feel good about their donations, while Black and Brown dollars will circulate within the Black and Brown community a little while longer. The overall knowledge and understanding that profits will be recycled into programs for a cause providing opportunities for disenfranchised individuals is conservative, yet liberal, but most important, revolutionary.  Contextual facts that support the secondhand model of consumerism: Goodwill Industries employs roughly 300,000 individuals. The United States is the world's leader in incarceration. There are 2 million people in the nation's prisons and jails—a 500% increase over the last 40 years. Employment opportunities following incarceration are often insufficient in scope when it comes to helping folks contribute to the community in a meaningful way and prevent repeat offenses.  Yet another layer of innovation will be in the export of excess material second-hand goods being shipped internationally to business and nonprofit partners in developing countries, such as Kenya Africa. These “3rd hand distribution” will be done at local markets initially and future N3WDOOM empowerment satellite locations.  Regarding staffing, we seek to provide intentional internships leading to employment opportunities for recently incarcerated individuals. We take pride in our model that gives people another chance, but with comprehensive and balanced guidance, pertaining to emotional self-awareness married with professional development.   Whether through retail positions at the N3WDOOM Inc second-hand stores, sorting and stocking donations or operating service vehicles for donation pickups, there are plenty of opportunities for professional development in alliance with the nonprofits parent company Newdoom Business Services LLC which seeks to establish warehouse facilities for the collection and processing of donated goods, recyclables and eventually waste.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Our programs are built around turning disenfranchised individuals in North and South Omaha into legitimate entrepreneurs and future business owners through our  network of business partners and industry leaders looking to hire and support the advancement of the Black and Brown community. The years following the launch of the N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment will be shaped by the previous successful program pupils, returning to equip their entrepreneurial endeavors with our newest program members, providing the mentorship and employment opportunities to the next generation that they were once so grateful to receive.  Within the N3WDOOM Center of Empowerment model emphasizing community enhancement through self-learning, outcome metrics based on overall communal/social cohesiveness can be measured through gainful employment, wage statistics, and a decrease in crime rates.  N3WDOOM Inc strives to provide wages ahead of the proposed 2026 minimum wage change,  offering part-time employees a base pay rate of $15 dollars per hour with the aspiration that our base pay rate increases to  $18 dollars/hour within our company by 2026. Communities with enhanced job security and access to emotional and professional skill-building resources lead to a decrease in crime statistics.  Our adjacent projects with Newdoom Business Services (see separate grant proposal) will lead to the growth of our processes and an increase in employment opportunities. The more donations we are able to collect from community members translates to different phases of our recycling business model. More collections equate to more jobs for both collections and distributions processed by our workforce development participants. Another metric for outcome success within the second-hand store will be the eventual expansion into exporting goods internationally to 3rd hand stores in Africa due to a surplus of collected goods. This will measure two things, we are collecting donations at a rate where it is necessary to replenish inventory, and second profit margins are allowing us to outsource materials tapping into new forms of service on a global scale.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The measurement of our outcomes can be monitored through new businesses established through N3WDOOM mentorship, increased job creation within the network, an increase in programs and program enrollment, an increase in base pay rate for direct employees, the overall growth of our network, and the expansion of second-hand goods shipped internationally after the community has received first dibs, creating a stable income stream for supporting the nonprofit.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Not only do we feel our proposal will attract additional investments, but we also welcome any and all investments through our major gifts director. We anticipate co-investments once programs go through their annual cycle demonstrating profound community impact and professional workforce development. We aim to have an extensive manager relationship network and a robust due diligence process which are important ingredients for the success of co-investment efforts. Our goal is to leverage a percentage of our network to project assets as a collective.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Our network of growing partners is too long to list. Please View our website www.n3wdoom.com for a more extensive look at our partnerships.  The nonprofit has fiscal sponsorship from The Simple Foundation in addition to being a proud member of the Nonprofit of the Midlands and formidable North Omaha Community Partnerships.   We are also partnering with The Honeycomb Foundation developing a housing resource for our Return to Citizenship Program.  The main partnership between N3WDOOM Inc. and its parent organization dba Newdoom Business Services will be a key supplier of resources and additional partnerships with an ever-expanding network of 20+ local businesses. As the N3WDOOM Inc. mission is to foster entrepreneurship and help build start-up small businesses, the nonprofit prioritizes growing individuals into assets for themselves, their families, and the community which leads to the N3WDOOM network of continued success.</p>

  <h3>AdditionalLocationDocuments</h3>
  <p> The N3WDOOM Community Center of Empowerment falls into QCT Area 20 of the South Omaha Census Tract. It is a heavily residential area on the main traffic street on the  # 13 public transit line. The proposed property is zoned R4 and has a park within a 5-10 minute walking distance. Outside of a neighborhood park, there are no major community resources regarding a Library or any other major points of interest in this community area.  It is not in a flood zone and has little specific danger regarding natural features. Air Quality is in the 50-60 percentile. The Environmental Health Index scores the property under 40-60  while the obesity health factor puts residents in the 37.2 - 44.1 percentile. According to the data, this place also has relatively low health factors. Per the survey, 76 to 90 percent of residents in the area have access to the internet. With all three properties, we are soliciting between N3wdoom Inc. and Newdoom Business Services Distribution Warehouse and the Recycling Center all within the same census tract, there are obvious and unlimited benefits that come from all three assets with such close proximity. Considering how all three properties hold crucial roles as a collective it makes sense to advantage of this close proximity.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Our request includes all the major start-up costs of nonprofit N3wdoom Inc. These costs include the funds for brick-and-mortar building, and program budget, and the staffing expenses for over 40 employees. Without these funds, the process to execute our mission and vision would be very gradual and the impact of our programs would have significantly less reach. We all firmly believe in the potential and the model this nonprofit is built on, with the ever-changing and evolving challenges our community members are facing gradual approaches could hinder our effectiveness and accelerated growth of programs due to the time and current events. For a quality program to flow it is important to project foresight, With the allocation of funding operations can start as soon as possible, this includes the hiring, training, and recruitment of program coordination and assistants.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The Legislative 1024 bill fits into our program outline so well it would be hard not to think the two would be synonymous. Our programs centered on entrepreneurship, economics, and even the adjustments made during COVID-19 pandemic have made it necessary to address the workforce. The innovation required to excel within the parameters of the designated census tract makes it significantly more challenging to get access to more resources. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity comes at a much-needed moment in time when access to resources has been withheld or gate-kept from the Black and Brown community of Omaha for so long. 
First and foremost the funds will be implemented to procure a brick-and-mortar building to house the N3WDOOM Community Center of Empowerment and thrift store in addition to providing salaries for 30+ until membership, sponsorship and donated items roll in adequate enough to provide long-term sustainability by 2026.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The model that outlines our Nonprofit’s Financial Sustainability is an innovative version of Goodwill Industries. With a modern approach and a target market group that consists of the economics largest consumer group on the planet, we have extreme confidence in the support our services will receive and provide, as well as the recycling of used goods across the nation. We also have a business model in place to outdo the competition of loyal Goodwill customers by providing pick-up services where employees collect donations from scheduled household sites rather than having the hassle and obstacle of hauling donations to a local goodwill store, as many don’t have their own transportation. We will simply outdo the competition by the convenience factor alone by coming to you. Not only do we provide jobs and resources to a target group of disadvantaged citizens, but we will also be recycling wealth within our community members, a feat never achieved in such a way, propelling groups and economies to a new level.We have broken down the necessary phases for managing expenses and obtaining assets essential to our business's operations. The phases are broken down from essential use to the necessary time to obtainment. In our attached PowerPoint the phases are elaborated on from an operational standpoint. Fiscal expenditure also is aligned with specific goals</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> The primary driving source of funding for our programs to continue after grant funds have been committed will be based on the business model we have to resale donations of clothes and home goods. Once our brick-and-mortar foundation and community space are in place we will allocate our resources to the acquisition and development of assets in the form of service vehicles in order to collect donations from community members and partners. We will also seek funds from membership dues, program enrollment outside of network participants, in-kind donations, annual fundraisers as well as additional office space and event rentals through our Center of Empowerment. Additionally, the service vehicles can solicit services for hauling items that don't fall under one of our donation classifications.    
As a nonprofit community-based service entity, we maintain a grant writer amongst the board members that will continue to pursue additional funds through the continued pursuit of other grants and other methods of funding.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Yes. Without adequate funds from the grant to purchase the community center and thrift store, N3WDOOM Inc will be required to continue operating solely online with limited scope and access to the population that the nonprofit strives to uplift. As the nonprofit is composed of dedicated and resourceful individuals, the community center is indeed inevitable, though the timeline would be greatly hindered without the grant funds outlined in this proposal.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> This proposal and business model are beyond scalable, the sole purpose of building this model is to make an impact on communities across the county on a national scale. The process can be completed in smaller components but consequently, the ability to scale would be delayed.  As proven through the initial operation of N3WDOOM Inc, empowerment-based courses can be made available online for immediate access in any community across the country. To truly scale the impact of this empowerment model, a community center building will need to be procured in order to support individuals with limited access to a computer or the internet.  A program-based reward system of non-fungible tokens (Doom Dollars - DDs) is earned through program participation and completion in addition to those rewarded for small business development and entrepreneurship efforts are achieved through membership enrollment, with any future membership dues being paid through donors, business partners, sponsors, and grants.   As program membership grows and the community enjoys the benefits of a local thrift store with door service for donated items picked up at households by partner organizations, such as Newdoom Business Services (see separate grant application for details), the community center can expand its scope to additional locations as well as establishing international partnerships shipping surplus items to 3rd Hand retails in Africa.  As the thrift store does not exclusively operate on the DDs and accepts cash purchases from the general public,  community awareness will grow pertaining to the use of DDs provided to members based on program participation which creates a cycle of self-empowerment not dependent on draining a family’s already strained resources. More and more of the community will register for courses and seek self-improvement to cultivate their own upward mobility through program participation and small business development support, enhancing economic growth across the race-based disparity gap, highlighted during COVID-19 throughout Omaha and beyond. Additionally, the model can be scaled back to an online platform in the event another pandemic occurs. This community center resource would be able to survive unforeseen tumultuous times, scaling up or down as needed to accommodate public health concerns as they arise.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> N3WDOOM Inc and Newdoom Business Services (NBS) have an unwavering financial commitment to each other. This may not be measured in a specific dollar amount per se, but is inherent in the capacity to carry the other entity's service expense if needed. 
The whole intention of designing the two entities as being separate but codependent provides for a strong strategic partnership that allows each to function individually with the support of the other. Both business models feed into each other from an operation, financial and manpower standpoint, cycling resources cohesively. 
Each entity is responsible for the division of its own expenses, yet provides a backup fail-safe support that bonafide the other,  ensuring neither fall short. This is particularly evident for the nonprofit, N3WDOOM Inc which is program-driven (aka quality courses that increase membership) and not profit-driven, with its greatest asset being successful program participants ready to provide strategic value through reliable workforce as staff for the NBS Recycle Center and distribution warehouse. Concurrently, the intention behind founding Newdoom Business Services was to provide financial backing for the N3WDOOM nonprofit and upward mobility for the community it serves.  We intend on providing the same structural support to the 20+ businesses within our N3WDOOM LLC Professional Network for exponential economic growth across diverse sectors of economic growth.</p>
