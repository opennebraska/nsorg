  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> My major accomplishments to date are running a rental business since 2018 and learning about real estate over the years. full renovating over 7 properties and being profitable has gave me the confidence in doing new construction. The spark academy with graduating and the connections I have made there have been life changing. This project provides a way for me to further improve and impact my community with providing infill housing using the existing lot sizes which a lot of firms are not doing. I've always made my rentals available to section 8 voucher holders in north Omaha because I was tired of slumlords not providing good living conditions. As I've attended the Spark development academy, I've grown to now wanting to develop infill lots with new housing for members of the community in North Omaha. My mission is to grow to one of the largest renters to section 8 voucher holders in the city and the largest minority developer with building new housing for the community for sale in North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>ProposalTitle</h3>
  <p> Maurice Project - New Construction Single Family Housing</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 2000000.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 2000000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> My project will include finalizing closing on the purchasing 3 vacant lots from the City of Omaha located on 2400 North and Ohio Block. This will also include a fourth lot from the Land bank (in progress). This project will also include the renovation of the back alley with the support of the Spark Organization and the city of Omaha. This will interact with the north Omaha trail being installed in the area and have alley accessible garages. We are planning for 3-bedroom 2 bath homes. 

We will complete the project with a current timeline estimated to start construction in Spring of 2023 and complete within 6 months in Fall 2023. This timeframe will include the Construction of the 4 new Single-family homes simultaneously on the vacant lots to be ready for sale to members of the community for pre-sale in Summer of 2023. We will implement a buyer selection process to meet all AMI etc. requirements. I plan on working with Habitat for Humanity and Omaha 100 organizations for perspective qualifying buyers on their waiting list.  

This funding would allow us to offer down payment assistance and for construction funding. We are also reviewing the possibility of using missing middle funds in conjunction with Spark. This process will be a proof of concept for documenting the process for other new developers and transparency with the community about how we can improve housing in areas with infill lots. We will create a sustainable program with great design to address these narrow infill lots.  If this proof of concept is successful there is additional vacant lots that will be the next phase to continue the development in this area. I would also like to use minority contractors from the Omaha chambers program REACH, minority General Contractor, Architect, etc. I want this project to benefit as many people as possible in the community.  This will also be a periodic session with the community and in conjunction with City council member in the district.</p>

This timeframe will include the Construction of the 4 new Single-family homes simultaneously on the vacant lots to be ready for sale to members of the community for pre-sale in Summer of 2023.

  <p> My project will include finalizing closing on the purchasing 3 vacant lots from the City of Omaha located on 2400 North and Ohio Block.

This will interact with the north Omaha trail being installed in the area and have alley accessible garages. We are planning for 3-bedroom 2 bath homes. This will help provide a sustainable community by creating housing in the qualified census tract area.  This project goes a step further in providing generational wealth and to fight gentrification with focusing on vacant lands and offering a process that buyers from the area have a chance at owning a house instead of being outbid or out of reach financially.  

We will complete the project with a current timeline estimated to start construction in Spring of 2023 and complete within 6 months in Fall 2023. This timeframe will include the Construction of the 4 new Single-family homes simultaneously on the vacant lots to be ready for sale to members of the community for pre-sale in Summer of 2023. We will implement a buyer selection process to meet all AMI etc. requirements. I plan on working with Habitat for Humanity and Omaha 100 organizations for perspective qualifying buyers on their waiting list.  This will help drive fundamental change in the community with developing additional housing stock in this area as well in tying in the development along 24th Street and the North Omaha Trail.

This funding would allow us to offer down payment assistance and for construction funding. We are also reviewing the possibility of using missing middle funds in conjunction with Spark.

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> My project addresses creating new housing options for members of the North Omaha census tract area. This speaks directly to the opportunity in developing housing using the vacant parcels of land in the area.  Also, with the Omaha Chambers REACH program and other programs speaks to creating meaningful opportunities with current community members and entrepreneurial paths to better their communities.  This project goes a step further in providing generational wealth and to fight gentrification with focusing on vacant lands and offering a process that buyers from the area have a chance at owning a house instead of being outbid or out of reach financially.  

Also, this development will help with the 24th and Lake corridors providing a continued catalyst for change in the area with connecting to current projects in the area like the North Omaha Trail. Also being a Minority developer myself that wants to continue to grow will be a dream to keep developing the area and grow my business to provide sustainable employment for my company but all the other contractors I intend on hiring from the community.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The purpose of this proposal is to take previously vacant land and develop them in the North Omaha census tract which is identified as disproportionately impacted community.  In addition, this proposal is focused on new construction of owner-occupied housing in a neighborhood and community with a demonstrated need for housing that is affordable and attractive to first-time homebuyers, middle-income families, and the emerging workforce.  The North Omaha 24th street corridor is A neighborhood or community that exhibits a demonstrated commitment to growing its housing stock.  The plan is to have this project completely completed in 24 months and will provide workforce housing to the community.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> My main innovation will be coming up with a sustainable model to make this project repeatable with building new construction affordable homes on vacant infill lots particularly with narrow lot widths.
