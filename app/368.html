  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> THE GLF is a faith based 501 (C)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes activities, education and partnerships that support the health and human service needs of individuals, youth and families.  Our team of volunteers include educators, advocates, entrepreneurs and community leaders who are willing to use their expertise for the aspiration of our students and their families.
The Guiding Light Foundation is dedicated to helping students achieve academic excellence by offering tutoring and mentoring. We currently offer after school tutoring and mentoring which provides the tools to encourage and help our youth accomplish their academic goals. Our tutors and mentors are teaching our students how to make good choices both academically and socially. 
Our tutoring program has also enlisted the help from some of our best high school and college students in Nebraska.  Our tutors and mentors offer help with reading, math and science homework, they also teach the students how to prepare for test and other academic challenges. 
Our after-school literacy program offer's academic support for our youth which helps promote literacy. The Keeping Kids Fed Program is also part of the after-school tutoring program. This program provides healthy snacks or meals daily. With the support from the Omaha Economic Recovery Act Coordination Plan, the Guiding Light Foundation will be able to go forward with our Saturday Academy which will focus on STEAM- an educational approach to learning science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. A big portion of the funds would be allocated towards our Liberal Arts department where kids will be introduced to Journalism, Photojournalism, Photography and Writing as a career. To support this work, we will need a functioning building, with the equipment and paid staff to run the program.

Our programs will also offer career exploration opportunities. These resources will also be provided for post-high school job training and higher education opportunities.  
GLF's mentoring programs and career resources will help families grow and develop into positive, productive and self-sufficient citizens.
 Our Summer Day Camps offered a wide range of events and activities to include basketball drill camps, dance/pom & cheer camps. Our Guiding Light Sparkles Cheer and Tumble Program is held at North Corp Salvation Army on 24th Pratt.
Follow “OUR FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT The Blog”, as we discuss future to strengthen community support of individuals and families by creating opportunities to share information, develop relationships and build connections among people and groups serving the community. SOME OF OUR FUTURE PLANS:

1. Under the umbrella of the Guiding Light Foundation, our vision is to partner up with other charitable organizations, local businesses and the community to add more programs and activities like health and wellness, parenting classes, legal aid, camping, concerts, retreats and rebuilding our neighborhood parks and playgrounds.

2. Organizing back to school events and school supplies drives to help parents fill in the gap wherever the need is and make sure that the students return to school goes smoothly.

3.  Being a charitable organization, the Guiding Light Foundation is committed to providing an outreach program that will focus on food insecurities by organizing food drives and building a food reserve that will help to feed children and families in our neighborhoods. Our long-term goal is to build a FOOD BANK that will distribute food on a monthly or bi-weekly schedule to families in need.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> As an upstart After School Academic and Tutoring Program, we strive for greater family and community involvement in our children’s learning, development, and achievements, closing the gaps which may exist in our local schools.  As with many after school programs, we depend on, and draw upon parent and community volunteers.  Our research data shows that when parents are involved their child’s learning they do better.  Educators can also expect that when family and community members make an investment a school academic program, interest, and involvement in children’s learning produces positive results in the child’s life, and in their outlook on higher education as a whole.
 
We are gradually developing best practices that fit within the confines of our local schools to develop working relationships where together we will recognize the importance of working together along with other community groups and agencies. As founder and CEO I recognize one group or program cannot be all things to all people, Studies show positive results by collaborating agencies and other organizations in service to our children.</p>
