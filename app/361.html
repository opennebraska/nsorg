  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> LIT is a social experience platform that provides the meta eco structure for social, digital and physical commerce to exchange at the rate of interaction, fostered by user experience. Our focus is to revolutionize the space between those experiences, the non-existing heights of current digital space and the untapped potential of social commerce and content. We thrive when innovation aligns social vaacuums and a need for products the reflects our generation. What that looks like is Facebook and Instagram social connectivity with Amazon’s business models. We could give countless examples of how our current options for social networking one, no longer meets the needs of our current generation while also explaining how the truest definition of a social network hasn’t been actualized until this very moment. What you are witnessing is the evolution of digital consumption driving technological innovation to reimagine the lines of commerce, content and experience. A place where investor returns meet the needs our society and hopes of our communities. We also have lounge locations for users to engage each other and live events for users to attend. We, embody the principles of excellence, equity, integrity, professionalism and sustainable use.</p>
