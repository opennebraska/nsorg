  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Overview: Boston School of Cosmetology is an innovative culture that has been developed to train and provide services for all hair types.  Specializing in muti-cultural and multi-textural hair types with an emphasis on chemistry and the chemical hair relaxer with education on how to properly maintain and care for chemically treated hair.  BSOC will prepare students for an entrepreneurial lifestyle by providing them with financial literacy courses as a part of the curriculum.  Teaching students the importance of filing their taxes and being financially responsible enables them to become a part of the growing statistics that prove that the field of cosmetology is a valid and financially lucrative trade.  This would allow for students with barriers to employment or education to be financially supported by state and local agencies, as they once were.  BSOC’s ultimate goal is to develop diverse professional cosmetologists.  BSOC will provide graduating students a location to work within the North Omaha area for one year.

Location: BSOC is located adjacent to a Qualified Census Tract at 5425 N. 103rd Street.  The owner/director, current employees, students trained, and the clients serviced live within multiple Qualified Census Tracts.  BSOC’s graduate placement salon will be located in North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Timeline: BSOC was approved and licensed December 2021.  We anticipate being accredited through the National Accrediting Commission of Career Arts and Sciences (NACCAS), making us eligible to offer Pell Grant and Federal Student Aid to our students.  We will also secure a salon location for graduating students.  Our expected time to meet our objectives is July 2026.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> BSOC's model addresses the need of policy and sustainable community by providing a much-needed educational experience that has not been available since the closing of LaRose Beauty Academy in 2012.  We will train and develop diverse professional cosmetologists living within Qualified Census Tracts with financial literacy as their foundation.  This will greatly impact the long-lasting economic growth in communities within Qualified Census Tracts. There is no other culturally diverse school dedicated to training and developing professionals in the whole of the state of Nebraska.  This gap in curriculum that addresses the unique hair and skin care needs of persons within the black and brown communities needs to be closed.  It is imperative that our students graduate and obtain their licenses so that they can serve their own communities with confidence.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Based upon Visioning Workshop Summaries, North Omaha experiences a need of 37% in policy.  BSOC’s curriculum, geared toward financial literacy and responsibility addresses the need of policy development that fit within the cultural context of education and finances.   Sustainable community needs are addressed through producing Qualified Census Tract stakeholders that are gainfully employed in the service industry and/or successful entrepreneurs in a field that provides sustainable wages.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> BSOC's model address two of LB1024's strategic priorities, entrepreneurship and employment. Many cosmetologists are sole proprietors operating small businesses.  BSOC has incorporated training in the area of entrepreneurship in order to assist students in the understanding of how to build a business that will enhance their communities.   Students that graduate our program are eligible to obtain their licenses and become gainfully employed within a matter of a few months.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The anticipated job creation for BSOC is estimated based upon our goal of a 75% graduation rate with 60% of students entering into the field.  The jobs consist of working as a cosmetologist in an existing salon or building their own small business.  Wages vary in the field of cosmetology.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> As a post-secondary school, it is hard to estimate how many permanent jobs will be created because not every cosmetologist desires to be an entrepreneur.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Starting wages are $15-$20 per hour.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> BSOC will be educating cosmetology professionals in the care of multi-cultural and multi-textural hair, which will ensure that businesses have a diverse and more appealing job candidate.  We will also build relationship and partnership with local businesses to ensure that their talent needs are met.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> BSOC will benefit the community in the following ways.  1) Creating high quality cosmetology professionals that will service the culture with excellence on all levels 
2) Providing graduates with a place to work following training for up to one year.  
3) Developing students to become entrepreneurs that create jobs    4)   Offering a Cosmetology Instructor's program that will foster professionals to continue to educate others to become above-standard professional cosmetologists.  5)  Educating on financial literacy to enable our students to create generational wealth for their families.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> BSOC will be a staple in the community and will educate, employ, and develop diverse professional cosmetologists.  These professionals will go on to employ others, become gainfully employed, and providing services that will contribute to economic and quality of life sustainability.</p>
