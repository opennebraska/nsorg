  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Omaha Construction Apprenticeship Program will be a self-administered self-sustaining program training covid-impact job seekers for new construction jobs. In our main training course students will build affordable housing. Upon completion of this program, we expect participants to be proficient in most areas of construction. 

We plan on building affordable housing in North and South Omaha QCTs targeting the Land Bank inventory, while training in groups of 25 covid-impacted participants at a time through our hands-on approach which combines classroom time with paid on the job training. Our 5-year training goal is 225 people trained and job-placed along with 50 affordable housing units built.

Our training will be split into modules so that we can train participants with the individual skills necessary to be rapidly placed in jobs. With our program we will be able to train participants for entry level specialty fields within weeks or they can complete the program and become full blown general contractors in 1 year. We can train people on any trade involved in the home construction process for skilled entry-level positions. 

Our priority is to teach people the skills they need to gain employment and help them to be placed into stable rewarding careers. Our program is free to our participants and we will pay them $15 -$20 per hour for hours worked outside of the classroom. Our intention of starting this program is to train participants for careers in the construction industry while providing all different types of affordable housing solutions. 

Our overall goal is to provide economic opportunity and prosperity for all. Inner City Change believes in building stronger communities through career training and affordable housing. We believe the dream of home ownership should be possible for all Americans willing to work for it. We believe in providing training to anyone who has a willingness to learn and a drive to better themselves.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> We plan on launching our program within 3 months of meeting our funding requirements. We will build 10 units of free-standing affordable housing in QCTs in North and South Omaha starting April 2024, while training our first participants. Scaling up as we go, funded by ongoing home sales, our sustainable 5-year goal is 225 people trained and job placed, and 50 affordable housing units built.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> There is a very high demand for skilled trade workers all throughout the United States. Data collected from the Census Bureau shows only 4.98% of the workforce in Omaha is employed in Construction. With the extreme demand for affordable housing and skilled trades workers to repair crumbling infrastructure all across the nation, the need for our program is greater than ever. 

There has never been a better time to learn a skilled trade. There is a massive nationwide shortage of skilled trade workers. In an article in the August 21, 2021 edition of The Economist was a projection that 40% of existing construction workers are expected to retire in the next 10 years. Not nearly enough people are entering the trades to make up for all those retirees. With the higher demand for workers comes a much higher wage. Students who successfully complete our Omaha Construction Apprenticeship Program, will have all the necessary knowledge to immediately enter the construction trade and begin their stable, fulfilling career. 

The poverty rate in Omaha is an astonishing 15.1%. This means that 1 in every 6 residents of Omaha live in poverty. According to spotlightonpoverty.org the percentage of working families under 200% of the poverty line is 29.2%, with 1/5 of the positions held being low wage. 

Housing costs and monthly income drastically affect a person's quality of life. Families who spend more than 30% of their monthly income on housing are considered cost burdened. These families almost always have difficulty affording necessities such as food, transportation and basic medical care. Our program aims at creating a truly sustainable community.  Here is the list of services we plan on providing that we believe QCTs in Omaha can benefit from;  Construction training, job placement, renting, selling and leasing of affordable housing, down payment assistance on all of our for sale projects,  transitional housing, emergency housing homelessness prevention research.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposed project aligns with these key findings form the Visioning Workshop summary:
- training opportunities
- utilizing vacant land to transform targeted QCTs in north and south Omaha
- substantial new investment in north and south Omaha qualified QCTs improving the quality of neighborhoods and removing problem vacant lots
- improving the quality of life for the neighbors of our projects and for the new covid-impacted homeowners of the homes we build in QCTs in north and south Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our program is transformational for the program participants trained in new careers in construction, and for the new homeowners in the QCTs we will build in. 

Fundamental Change occurs through our Project by the investment momentum, rising surrounding home value, and area improvements that occur when you build a new home in an inner-city area.

Lasting Economic Impact occurs through the new careers we prepare our participants for, and for the new affordable housing stock added in north and south Omaha QCTs.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We plan on employing 6 full time people to administer the program. These positions will average $45000 per year.                         

We plan on training 50 participants per year. Our participants will be paid $15 - $20 per hour depending upon initial their skill level and personal needs. We expect to see our successful participants transition into permanent employment in the construction trades industry with plenty of room for financial and economic growth.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> We plan on employing 6 full time people to administer the program. These positions will average $45000 per year.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 275</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> nothing lower than $20/hour to start for training workers, and $45,000 per year for instructors</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Participants that successfully complete our program will be ready for hire in specialty trade fields as well as general carpentry/ construction trades. There is a huge demand for contractors finding quality help and we plan to help bridge that gap. Front end training cost is one of the biggest hurtles that smaller contractors face when searching for quality employees. Unfortunately, many times the cost of training stops disadvantaged small businesses from expanding.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Inner City Change believes that education and affordable housing can drastically benefit a community, especially among covid-impacted job seekers in targeted QCTs.

Countless studies have been conducted about the correlation between income and quality of life. Helping individuals in the community gain valuable training and giving them opportunities to high paying jobs is one of the fastest ways to better an entire community and raise the living standards in the QCTs we will build new affordable housing in. 

Inner City Change believes providing affordable housing is an equally important part in bettering any community. The need for affordable housing is imperative not only for families but also neighborhoods. The benefits to affordable housing are endless. When families worry less about making their rent or mortgage payment those families are able to spend more money on nutritious food and other essential items. Increasing buying power for low income families can mean steady income for local small businesses, more job creations and higher economic growth.

Affordable housing developments create diversity by creating communities of people of different cultural, Socio economic, and educational backgrounds. Diversity in a community helps to increase the knowledge of cultural sensitivity, fairness, and understanding of different backgrounds, this ultimately leads to a better overall community. Building relationships across ethnic and racial lines helps to stabilize and strengthen a community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The economic impact of the temporary and permanent jobs created, as well as the long-term impact of new affordable housing stock will transform the impacted environment and greatly increase livability inside the QCTs the program operates in.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Our OPAC program is innovative in the way that we pay to teach our participants the skills that they need to be successful in the construction industry while creating affordable housing. The people we hire and train to build housing are likely to be the people that are most at need of affordable housing. Inner City Change is committed to implementing a diverse trade program and creating affordable housing throughout Omaha.  America was built on the backs of tradesmen. Unfortunately, throughout the last few decades trade skills have been rapidly declining. People have instead turned to higher education, four-year degrees and let’s be honest, years of debt. Not everyone is cut out for college. Many students struggle to graduate from high school, forcing them into mediocre jobs in retail or service. Our program aims to provide students with lifelong skills and job placement into rewarding, high paying careers.  The Omaha Construction Apprenticeship Program will be implemented in the very neighborhoods our students grew up in. Our unique program will help revitalize and improve these blighted neighborhoods, bringing affordable housing, and higher property values to existing homes. Our students will truly be giving back to the same community that embraced them as they grew, creating a stronger, even more tight knit environment.  The concept of affordable housing is not new, but it is a problem most of our nations‘ cities are facing. With the rising cost of land, labor, material and lack of skilled trades workers to build these homes, it would seem that “affordable housing” is no longer attainable. Inner City Change believes everyone should have access to affordable housing.  Our not for profit program was designed to provide affordable housing, while implementing the use of our Apprenticeship Program attendees and their Master instructors to build these affordable, energy efficient units. Keeping costs low means our marginal profits from the sale of these affordable homes can sustain the cost of the program so more affordable housing can be built. The innovation to our program lies in the sustainability and multifaceted benefits of giving the residents of Omaha access to high paying careers while building affordable housing in their communities.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Our programs will measured the numbers of trainees completing the curriculum, the number of them hired into construction jobs, and the number of new affordable houses we provide the community.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Our programs success will be measured by what skills we train, how many people are trained, how many participants are placed into careers, as well as the amount of affordable housing built. These outcomes will be monitored and measured by our program director.  This program can be a catalyst for secondary investment as many of our units will be sold to continue funding our program. This gives investors safe clean housing to rent. This program will also open up the possibility of homeownership to individuals who may not otherwise qualify.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> New homes built in existing neighborhoods will increase the values of neighborhoods through their higher than surrounding sales price, which coudl inspire surrounding owners to improve their properties, improving the appearance and enjoyment and safety of the neighborhoods and QCTs we build new homes in.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
