  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Ebony Patriot LLC plans to establish an incubator style enterprise that will provide office, meeting and event space to both nonprofit and for profit organizations.  The Visioning Workshops for both North and South Omaha identified a need for a business incubator.  Ebony can provide such a space immediately and is located in the target area for LB1024 funds. Adjacent to Interstate 480 and Highway 75, in the revitalized Midtown area the building has public transit access from both North and South Omaha as well as available parking. The location is within an Opportunity Zone, HUB Zone. The building is a condominium arrangement of commercial and residential units.
	The overall goal of this incubator is to help both business and nonprofit organizations grow and build their foundations and exercise solid business practices while using a shared or coworking space that is inexpensive for the organization and promotes collaboration. Collaborating with other community resources is needed to provide management support and financial education for new entrepreneurs. 
	The incubator itself will need employees and the organizations using the space will create additional jobs through growth in their respective areas. Nonprofit organizations as well as businesses can use the space for offices, meetings or exhibits. The space can also accommodate individuals working from home that need private space for meetings or virtual events. Collaborating with partners such as local universities, nbdc, SBA and others will be pursued to provide advisory and educational support.
	The project can become self supporting because it has the potential to house an independent coffee shop and the event space can be rented to produce ongoing revenue.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> o	Office spaces are available now.
o	Additional office spaces are planned with the purchase of space adjacent to the currently available area.
o	A search for partners to provide the expert support for users is being initiated.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Early in the pandemic, April 3, 2020, an article appeared in the Des Moines Register asking “Will COVID-19 kill coworking spaces?"  This proposal answers “No!”.  Ebony Patriot began establishing an event venue in 2018 at 3000 Farnam but the pandemic has effectively killed that operation. This availability of LB 1024 funds creates a much more worthwhile and exciting enterprise. Ebony Patriot proposes a coworking space that will promote collaboration and provide advisory resources as well.
	At present, Ebony owns an area of 4700 square feet. About 3000 square feet of that is configured as an open event venue for hosting up to 200 people. There are also separate rooms for offices or meetings. With some renovation, another 1000 square feet can be reconfigured and leased out to a retail coffee shop to generate revenue that can help minimize costs for users.  Being located in a building with over 113 residential units provides a ready market for the coffee shop.  Ebony is currently also leasing the adjacent 1,030 square feet that needs no renovation to provide 4 more office or meeting rooms.  Purchase of this space is desirable and is included in this proposal.
	Partially inspired by “The Forum ATL A CoWorking Space for the Modern Entrepreneur” in Atlanta Georgia, www.theforumatl.com. Locally, the Modus Coworking space is focused on premium spaces.  This project offers space and services to entrepreneurs and organizations at a more modest level to encourage growth and community benefit.  It is expected to become self- supporting with revenue from the event space and retail coffee shop in the future. Beginning on a small scale, and including the advisory services as well as meeting room needs, shared printing and presentation capabilities, etc., the incubator can become a self-sustaining, long-term asset to the business community. Initially, some grant funds will be used for operating expenses for the incubator itself to keep expenses for users as low as possible with that balance being reevaluated periodically.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> o	The SWOT results on pages A12 and A13 in the Public Engagement Summary from both the North and South Omaha groups identified needs that clearly relate to this proposal. Threats identified included connecting North Omaha to downtown and needing meeting and community space in South Omaha. 
o	The Needs Comments on pages A58-A62 mention a “business hub” in South Omaha and a “project incubator space for businesses” in North Omaha. This project addresses exactly those needs. 
o	Both the North and South area groups identified a negative public perception of older areas of the city in the Needs Comments.  The available location being in a vibrant, growing area between North and South Omaha shows the public that older areas of the city are desirable and economically viable.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> o	LB 1024 itself provides for small business support in Section 4(2) and identifies a potential for an innovation hub in Section 4(4). In addition to meeting needs identified as above, this project can be initiated</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> o	The Omaha World Herald October 1, 2022, issue reported that the University of Nebraska Medical Center has announced plans for a business hub that will include space for biotech and technology startups.  This is a clear indicator of the need for projects of this type. 
o	The UNMC project is expected to be finished in spring 2024. This project can begin now at a micro level to grow small businesses into larger enterprises.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Jobs at incubator location, others by users at unknown locations</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> o	The Midtown location attracts visitors from throughout the city to its housing, restaurants, businesses and many amenities.  The presence of the incubator demonstrates to visitors that older areas of the city have more to offer than they realized.  
o	The event space being available for multicultural exhibits and civic group events as well as providing space for small businesses to grow will be a valuable tool in reversing negative perceptions that have long existed.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> o	Sustainable Community is achieved by incorporating the rental revenue generated by the coffee shop and availability of the event center for the entire Omaha community.</p>
