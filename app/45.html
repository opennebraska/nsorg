  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Kay Apartments located at 118 North 31st Street, OMaha, NE 68131.  It serves as an anchor to Gifford Park area located on the Northeast corner of 30th and Dodge.  The project includes the redevelopment of 10 units within a historic structure offering workforce housing opposite to Midtown Crossing.  Often, we discuss the gentrification of neighborhoods and mega redevelopment efforts that price residents out of neighborhoods that they have and wish to continue to reside within.  The project has historically catered to Creighton University students and service professionals within the area.

The project has already been approved for tax increment financing.  The project has been designed.  The project can start within six (6) months of being awarded.  Management currently owns and operates the Turner Court Apartments.    

The project would revitalize a property that had been vandalized.  Coupling changes in code and requirements of historic preservation have caused significant obstacles to the project. 
Project assistance is needed to bridge the cost to preserve the historic structure and rehabilitate the shell back into functioning units made available as workforce housing units.  If awarded, ownership will earmark a ten (10%) goal of subcontractors that are minority-owned or disadvantaged.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> See Schedule attached; however, note that the project is designed, approved, estimated and would be completed before year end 2023.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We believe that this housing stock that A). represents the neighborhoodâ€™s historic characteristics. B). is approachable in terms of costs for our workforce. C) has access to multi-modal transportation (ORBT - .1 miles). D). is adjacent to demand drivers for those residents in need (service retail and education) E) provides workforce housing, in particular, to those part time college students who cannot afford campus living F) functions adjacent to public parks for families to enhance quality of life. G) is adjacent to a mega redevelopment (Midtown Crossing) while still provided workforce housing opportunities.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> 1). Housing (Workforce) was a common theme throughout the visioning summary
2). Proximity to employment
3). Multimodal transportation (.1 miles to bus station)
4). Walkability to services (health and grocery)
5). Proximate to education (YATES and Creighton University)
6). Redevelopment of a vacant building will improve safety and improve perception of North side of omaha which is often impaired by displacement, unintentionally, by large scale redevelopments (ie. Midtown Crossing). This improves Safety</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Accessible workforce housing while also creating opportunities for small and disadvantaged businesses to be part of the solution to their own neighborhood.  Improving vacant buildings will enhance safety and improve service businesses in the area by enhancing demand.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The economic impact should not be simply weighed by the redevelopment project, but the preservation and affordability provided for those in the workforce within the area.  The preservation of those positions between 80% and 130% of the Area Median Income (AMI) could enable almost 20 positions.

Additionally, 30 more jobs would be created (5 permanent and 25 temporary).

Lastly, the set aside of 10% for minority and disadvantaged businesses allows community members to be a part of the solution and ideally enhance their own economics.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We are aiming to create a set aside of 10% for minority and disadvantaged businesses</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> There are many community benefits.  The project is located in a QCT as well as a visible intersection on the north side of Dodge Street.  The investment will encourage additional redevelopment projects within the Gifford Park area and will improve safety and encourage more workforce to live where jobs are.  The enhanced density will assist employers find employees while providing the employees a culturally significant place to live with associated services in a walkable area.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The site is within the Gifford Park neighborhood which has parks, schools and other services.  WLG has maintained offices in this area since our inception 20 years ago and believe that more proof of investment will encourage others to improve the neighborhood.  Quality of Life and safe, affordable housing would be showcased on a stage.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Creating more skilled jobs through the set aside delivery.  Creating more workforce housing for employees to live within the neighborhood in which they work.  When siting office space, often employers pin map their staff.  Ideally, we create more staff to be located near their place of employment.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> this would be measured by available housing (market data is measured by city), employees living in area (measured by chamber)</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> yes.  we believe this project will prove that further investment in Gifford Park could be successful.  Additionally, it will expand our skilled labor pool by set aside program.  This will make more investment viable by larger supply of subcontractors.</p>
