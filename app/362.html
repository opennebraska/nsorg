  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Legacy Staffing Solutions will be able to create 105 jobs within an18-month period by 
creating positions both internally and filling outside contract positions with healthcare 
workers locally and throughout the state. I am confident that we have the foundation 
and experience to be a successful company. We just need the team and funding to be 
able to make that a reality. 
January 2023- March 2023. We plan on hiring for recruitment team and supporting 
staff. Once training is completed, we will begin filling our client positions immediately
with healthcare travelers. 
See attachment to show our timeline and goal of placing 90 travelers within 18 months</p>

Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our company has the unique opportunity to provide employment for the community while providing 
resident care for the community at the same time providing a service for our growing elderly 
population and facilities that are generally short-staffed. We will have resources to promote 
advancement within the company and provide higher wages than most jobs.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We will be providing employment and investing in creating a business that will be in North Omaha for 
many years to come that will continue to provide stable income to families that live and work in 
North Omaha. Along with being an active partner with other area businesses to promote and build
positive connections.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> We have been at our location for over a year. I can say it is gratifying to see the connections we have
established so far with our immediate residential neighbors and businesses. We look out for each 
other, communicate if we feel there is something that would benefit or hurt our wellbeing and 
network on a regular basis. My hope is that our business district will continue to foster that positive 
interaction and expand with other businesses in North Omaha to provide more unity for the 
community to benefit from. 
How does this proposal contribute to community sustainability (economic, built and natural 
environment, and quality of life)?
The more jobs we can provide will have a ripple effect in the community starting with increased 
wages, more opportunities for advancement and physical and financial relief for the individuals that 
we work with and their families.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> We want to be known as a company that is dedicated to service with a purpose. We want to interact 
with intention and integrity. With the efficiency of a large corporation and the integrity of a small 
business. By doing this and being relevant to the healthcare industry this will set us apart from other 
agencies.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> On-going education and advancement are always encouraged when working with our company.
Flexibility with scheduling if needed due to different family dynamics or continued education
commitments are another benefit with LSS plus it allows our travelers to continue to earn high 
wages and balance prior obligations that are important to them.</p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> Our office has been in operation for over a year. We wanted a location that could grow with us as we 
grew. We didn’t make this decision lightly. We wanted a spot that reflected in the values and culture 
that we were creating as a company. A location where we could have a positive impact not only 
through employment, taking pride in caring for residents in the community along with partnerships in
the community that our business put roots down at and make a difference to families we employ but 
future generations. This spot was extremely appealing in achieving our vision and building that 
legacy. We have great business neighbors (Hope Center) along with amazing residential neighbors. 
We are beyond pleased with the choice to start our business in North Omaha.</p>
