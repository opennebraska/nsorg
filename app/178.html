  <h3>TeamExplanation</h3>
  <p> As an established nonprofit organization providing essential services in Douglas and Sarpy Counties, Eastern Nebraska Community Action Partnership (ENCAP) relies on a strong leadership team and numerous support staff to ensure high-quality services and programs, to act as an effective steward of its resources, and to implement continuous quality improvement practices. Executive Director Aaron Bowen and Deputy Director Jill Connor have a combined thirty years of experience in community and program development, fundraising, contract negotiation, federal grants management, community needs and resources assessment, financial oversight, and staff coaching and development in the nonprofit arena. Additional leadership team members include Nicki Murphy, Program Design and Evaluation Manager; Katie Cue, Human Resources Generalist; Roselyn Peitzmeier, Support Services Manager; Deanna Wagner, Bellevue Food Pantry Manager; Sara Haecke, Senior Accountant; and Mike Vaughn, Chief Financial Officer. Each of these individuals has substantial experience in their respective area of oversight.  Other team members who will play a significant role in the project described below include Wilson Rivas, Transportation Supervisor; Paula Dingman, Dispatch Coordinator; and Alexis McGee, Operations and Project Coordinator.</p>

  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> The attached ENCAP Organizational Chart provides a visual representation of the leaders and team members assigned to each of the six (6) primary departments at ENCAP: the agency’s Print Shop (North O Print Co.), the Bellevue Food Pantry, Program Design and Evaluation, Senior Wellness, Support Services (Emergency Financial Assistance), Nutrition, and Transportation. The flowchart of supervisory responsibilities includes administration (Executive Director, Deputy Director) and department managers. See attachment “ENCAP Org Chart with Descriptions”. 
A 15-member Board of Directors composed of one-third private sector representatives, one-third publicly elected officials, and one-third individuals with lived experience with poverty or substantial work experience with individuals facing poverty holds ultimate oversight of the agency. This structure is mandated for all Community Action Agencies and is intentionally designed to forge connections between individuals with decision-making power, and the community members who need ENCAP’s help most.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> ENCAP has been serving Eastern Nebraska as a 501c3 nonprofit organization since 1965. Our mission is to reduce the power of poverty in Eastern Nebraska through direct service, and results-driven partnerships. We serve approximately 20,000 services to over 11,000 individuals each year, and we are committed to designing programs that effectively respond to these local needs. 
ENCAP consistently conducts research on promising and evidence-based practices and evaluates the performance and effectiveness of all its programs and activities. Examples of recent projects and accomplishments that demonstrate ENCAP’s influence and impact include: 
ENCAP published its Transportation and Mobility Challenges of Households Facing Poverty Report in 2020 (see attached). The data indicated that transportation challenges have been a consistent deterrent to individuals and families accessing needed services, and achieving economic stability. With the community’s input, we continue to explore how to meet the growing demand for transporting job seekers who face barriers to acquiring and maintaining stable employment. 
 
ENCAP is working to establish its North Omaha space at 2406 Fowler Avenue–as a high-impact destination for economic and community development. We are working to renovate portions of our space usable meeting and office spaces for area nonprofits organizations and small businesses to create a stronger hub for change and community development discussions. 


Aiming to improve the lives of older adults and the futures of vulnerable children in North Omaha, ENCAP has become only the 2nd site in the country to implement the Generation Xchange (GenX) Program, a partnership with the UCLA Department of Medicine (Divisions of Geriatrics and General Internal Medicine), Omaha Public Schools, and UNMC’s Center for Reducing Health Disparities. The mission of GenX is to promote greater health and wellness outcomes in at-risk older adults, while simultaneously supporting greater academic and behavioral outcomes for children in kindergarten through 3rd grade. Currently, ENCAP operates this program at Lothrop Elementary and seeks to expand this program to Minne Lusa Elementary in 2023. 
Finally, on September 30, 2022, ENCAP completed two years of investing $1.6 million in federal Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) CARES funding in Douglas and Sarpy Counties to combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding arrived with rigorous regulations and monitoring, and ENCAP utilized this funding successfully to help families stay housed, fed, and employed; to increase vaccination rates in North Omaha through funding of a staff position at UNMC’s Center for Reducing Health Disparities; to leverage additional new funding; and to build the sustainability of its high-impact programs. 

If funded under this application to expand the foundational capacity of its transportation program, ENCAP will create a sustainable solution to the long-standing mobility challenges that prohibit too many residents of North Omaha and adjacent neighborhoods who are most vulnerable to poverty from accessing and maintaining gainful employment, and in turn building their savings and overall wealth.</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> If funded, ENCAP will expand its fleet of vehicles, create new, permanent driver and driver support jobs, make needed infrastructure and systems improvements needed to support additional routes, and provide employer-sponsored transportation to and from work for those living in areas of North Omaha with the highest rates of poverty and unemployment. This plan provides substantial, far-reaching benefits to business and available workers, creating a more stable community workforce, generating more productivity, and increasing business profits and household incomes. ENCAP’s proposed program has the potential to create wealth a multiple levels in the community.
We know that employment is essential to reach economic security; however, based on the data ENCAP collects and its experience with consumers, we know also that if an individual cannot get to work, their opportunities are exponentially limited. Too many jobs that pay a livable wage are inaccessible without reliable transit tailored to the challenges that households living in poverty face. For business owners, offering a mobility solution for its workforce can be far less expensive than the costs of constant rehiring and training.
Although mass transit or ride services play a central role in mobility, they are often unable to meet the unique needs of families in our community who face significant economic and social challenges. Transportation to/from employment must include the ability to get children to/from childcare safely; must be timely when a car breaks down or a ride falls through; must be able to pivot quickly in response to changes in our community; and must be responsive to employers.  
This expansion would create a long overdue transportation solution for communities most adversely impacted by long-term poverty, as well as the health and economic challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create. It also would strengthen the workforce of businesses in the community and generate economic growth. With the proper financial support, the ENCAP Transportation Program could be operational at the levels needed to begin to serve the community in year 2 of the award, 50% capacity by the beginning of year 3, and after incremental increases annually, at full capacity in year 5.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> ENCAP would utilize funding to create 25 FTE’s (generating a total income of $3,603,600); complete a feasibility study to determine where new transportation routes are needed most, and by what community populations, employers, and educational/training institutions; make substantial fleet and transportation improvements that are necessary for efficient operation of the program at a larger scale; secure appropriate contractors per ENCAP bid procurement policies; work consistently with the zoning commission to ensure there are no zoning concerns; secure the approval of the Nebraska Public Service Commission to operate the program per applicable regulations; and secure contracts with employers and education/training institutions to build the long-term financial sustainability of the program.
The timeline for the program is as follows:

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> In 2020, ENCAP conducted a comprehensive study on transportation and mobility challenges facing households in poverty in partnership with over 60 community agencies. The study shed light on the challenges with transportation that underscored households’ ability to reach economic stability. On average, respondents experienced six different types of transportation challenges including: the inability to afford Uber, Lyft, or cab services; inability to afford fuel as costs increase; difficulty maintaining or repairing a vehicle; difficulty purchasing a vehicle due to credit; and challenges with using public transit due to distance to the nearest bus stop.
In addition, 47.3% of respondents indicated that they do not have others to rely on for a ride, 45% indicated that they have no access to a household vehicle, 46.4% reported that rides from friends or family often fell through, and 44.4% of respondents reported that they were unable to afford vehicle payments.
Responses from citizens of North Omaha, areas that include 20 qualified census tracts, showed higher proportions of respondents that faced the primary transportation challenges noted. For example:
An average of 53.3% of North Omaha respondents reported difficulty purchasing a vehicle due to credit, an average of 53.3% in comparison to 48.3% of all respondents.
An average of 59.6% of North Omaha respondents indicated that they have difficulty repairing or maintaining a vehicle, in comparison to 53.9% of all respondents.
An average of 48.9% of North Omaha respondents indicated that they have no access to a household vehicle, in comparison to 45% of all respondents.
In addition, 35.7% of North Omaha respondents reported being unable to use public transportation due to the distance to the nearest bus stop, along with 36.7% of NW Omaha respondents.
These transportation challenges align with additional community reports that list transportation as a significant variable to navigate to sustain gainful employment for substantial portions of Omaha metro area residents. For example, in the most recent Labor Availability and Hiring Needs Report for Omaha, developed by the Nebraska DOL, it was reported that 26.1% of potential job seekers list proximity to public transportation as an important factor in job selection. This equates to 73,287 individuals of 280,793 total potential job seekers. In addition, 45.6% of potential job seekers listed a lack of job opportunities in the local area as an obstacle to employment and 14% of potential job seekers indicated that transportation was an obstacle to employment.
These responses from community members show that it is crucial  to the economic recovery and sustainability and wealth growth of North Omaha to address transportation and mobility challenges for potential job seekers and current working adults. Although there are long-term plans to improve the City of Omaha’s transportation infrastructure and public transportation system, we know that the benefits of such improvements already are long overdue and rarely meet the needs of residents who face the causes and conditions of poverty each day. Being a successful worker–earning a living wage, having the opportunity for promotion, and establishing a long-term career–stems largely from having the ability to get to and from work on a consistent basis. The problem is as simple as that; however, far too many households remain mired in low-wage jobs with no upward mobility because that problem remains unsolved. 
Omaha needs multimodal transportation systems that provide adequate transportation for residents to attend interviews and job training, secure living wage jobs, have consistent attendance at work, and ultimately perform at higher levels on a long-term basis. This system must accommodate their unique needs for child transport and navigating urgent, and sometimes crisis, situations. ENCAP’s proposed transportation program will meet this unmet need.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Visioning Workshops summaries identified multiple references to transportation challenges. In the North Omaha workshops, SWOT analyses identified weaknesses with connectivity in the community such as concern that public transit options are limited and do not meet the needs of the current population, and concern that walkability in the community is limited due to safety concerns. In addition, needs identified by participants at the Visioning Workshops included reliable forms of transportation for citizens, alternative routes of transportation, and generally safe and affordable transportation from home to work, school, healthcare, and other important destinations.  
Visioning Workshops identified concerns about the ability of public transit to meet the needs of the community due to older street structure that limits east to west route availability, Highway 75 causing challenges to efficient public transit, and limited funding to improve public transit systems.
At the same time, Visioning Workshop participants identified public-private partnerships creating community investment, momentum, and support as a significant opportunity for the North Omaha area. 
As a trusted collaborator in North Omaha, ENCAP proposes expansion of its existing transportation to fill several of the major gaps identified in the Visioning Workshops, and we would work with public transportation, Metro Community College, Heartland Workforce Solutions and other nonprofit partners, and small and large employers to design the most impactful program possible. As the program becomes operational, we would work with the local workforce development system and leading employers to design a rate structure that is sustainable for the local market. ENCAP aims to help businesses recognize the importance of investing in work-related rides, and provide a program on which these businesses can rely on to help maintain a stable and productive workforce.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Financial support for expansion of ENCAP’s transportation program aligns with the strategic priorities of LB 1024. Expansion of the program would address the economic recovery of the North Omaha community and the following qualified census tracts: 4, 8, 12, 59.01, 59.02, 60, 3, 6, 7, 54, 53, 52, 11, 49, 50, 51, 65.06, 63.02, 63.03, 58; north of Dodge Street and east of 72nd Street, that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency and related challenges.
With a diversity of nonprofit organizations, developers, and businesses increasing economic and career opportunities in the community through the available economic opportunity funding, expansion of ENCAP’s transportation program will be a catalyst for individuals and families to take advantage of these opportunities. As mentioned prior, in 2020 ENCAP completed a comprehensive study on transportation and mobility challenges facing households in poverty in partnership with over 60 community agencies. The study emphasized the importance of reliable transportation to a household’s ability to reach economic stability. On average, respondents experienced six different types of transportation challenges including: the inability to afford Uber, Lyft, or cab services; inability to afford fuel as costs increase; difficulty maintaining or repairing a vehicle; difficulty purchasing a vehicle due to credit, and challenges with using public transit due to distance to the nearest bus stop. These findings are consistent with research that suggests that low-income individuals are more likely to take public transit to work due to the high cost of owning and maintaining a vehicle. A study investigating barriers to employment among TANF participants found that approximately one in three individuals (35.5 percent) lost a job or a job opportunity due to transportation challenges. The likelihood of job loss increased with the use of a fixed (i.e. inflexible) route bus service, due to long travel times to and from home, the need to get children to and from care, and work shifts outside of the operating hours. For these reasons, research shows that public transit is not always a solution for households struggling against economic challenges. The people most in need of jobs and opportunities for economic mobility cannot wait for public transit to meet their needs; they need a transportation provider that understands their plight and is able and can adapt nimbly to their life situations. 
Employers also need a provider who will listen to them and adjust its practices (e.g. changing pick up or drop off times, creating routes to new job sites, etc.) to help prevent workforce interruptions. Growing ENCAP’s capacity to provide work- and education-related transportation will create economic opportunity. Improving the work and training attendance of employees improves business productivity for both small and larger businesses. The availability of work-sponsored transportation has the potential to support the creation of new small businesses in the area, increase the capacity of current businesses, and attract new businesses to the community. In addition, through this project ENCAP will create permanent driver and driver support jobs that pay a living wage and provide health benefits, two essential components of building wealth and economic stability.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> ENCAP Transportation Program (ETP) Drivers will be paid $20/hr and work an average of 6 hrs/day. These positions will be eligible for health benefits, retirement contributions, and PTO. The drivers currently employed by the ETP reside in some of the target zip codes that experience high rates of economic instability including 68105, 68107, 68111, 68112, 68116, 68131, 68152, and 68154.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Expansion of ENCAP’s transportation Program would initially create approximately 26 new driver and driver support jobs at ENCAP to be added to the existing team. All jobs at ENCAP offer competitive wages based on current market rates, flexible scheduling, on the job training, and health benefits.   Businesses and contractors need a stable workforce to execute their projects. An expanded transportation program customized to meet both employer and worker needs will create a new, essential service that improves economic opportunity and mobility in the Qualified Census Tracts.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> There are several advantages for employers to provide transportation support to their employees, including but not limited to:  attracting and retaining workers, minimizing payroll taxes, enhancing customer access to services and goods, expanding service hours, minimizing individual vehicle gas emissions and conserving energy, reducing required parking, demonstrating company support of work-life balance, and developing their company’s reputation as a partner with workers. (FCT, 2022). In turn, these improvements ripple to the entire community and increase its livability and improve households’ contributions to the local economy. 
In the 2020 ENCAP study on transportation and mobility challenges facing households in poverty, 38% of respondents reported being prevented from reaching their place of employment at least once in the past year due to transportation barriers, and over 18%  reported being prevented from reaching their place of employment 4 or more times in the past year. In the ENCAP report, 34.4% of respondents reported being prevented from accessing employment opportunities at least once in the previous year, with 15.6% of respondents reporting being prevented from doing so 4 or more times. In addition, of respondents with children under the age of five, 26.2% were unable to transport their child to daycare while they attended work or school activities. 
Individuals with developmental, mental, and visual disorders–all of whom should have the opportunity to work–have some of the lowest rates of mobility compared to others. In the ENCAP transportation and mobility challenges survey, 50.2% of respondents with a self-reported disability did not have a driver’s license, and public transportation and paratransit services were not accessible, reliable, or safe. The majority felt that rides to work would help to maintain employment. 
The two most frequently reported challenges amongst all populations were the inability to afford Uber, Lyft, or cab services and the cost of gas. In Nebraska, gas costs an average of $2,943 annually and is rising. This equates to approximately 13.8% of the total income for a family of three living below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,330). To reduce expenses, many respondents use the public transit system. However, many of those who are public transit-dependent live in areas that are not well connected. According to reports, 36.2% of respondents in Douglas County were not within walking distance of a bus stop. Many study participants indicated that the current public transit system is inadequate in meeting their needs, citing these challenges in particular:
·        No service in the early mornings, evenings, and Sundays.
·        Inability to ride long distances (e.g., taking three hours to travel each way for work or
·        health care).
·        Inconvenient transfers, especially when needing to make multiple stops.
·        Difficulty planning trips due to discontinued routes and infrequent or inconsistent pick up times. 
When asked what resources could be offered to meet their transportation and mobility needs, 28.9% of respondents identified door-to-door ride services as an effective resource to meet their needs. Respondents rated improvements to the public transit system second (14.7%), followed by financial assistance to purchase a vehicle (11.4%). 
ENCAP’s project is a direct response to what community members have indicated is the right approach to decrease mobility challenges in Omaha, especially in North Omaha, and increase income stability for both citizens and businesses. The transportation challenges in the community are historical and far-reaching, and ENCAP’s proposed program expansion is an innovative, actionable, and scalable program targeted to reduce the power of these challenges.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> According to the ConnectGO Getting to Work Survey (CGTWS) from the Greater Omaha Chamber, Metropolitan Area Planning Agency (MAPA) and Verdis Group, transportation barriers are deterring job candidates from joining organizations with high numbers of available entry level positions, and there is demand for support of free transit passes provided by employers and access to multimodal transportation options.
Several organizations reported that potential job candidates cited a lack of access to a car as a barrier. On average, 100 potential candidates could not work at their organization due to a transportation barrier (CGTWS). In addition, according to the NDOL, 7.3% of potential job seekers in the Omaha area cited lack of childcare as a barrier to employment and 16% cited accessible childcare as an important factor in taking a new job.
The ENCAP transportation program would primarily serve zip codes in North Omaha where many of these entry level positions are available, and where many young families live. The target zip codes for the expanded ETP will be 68110, 68111,68131, 68104, and 68152. These zip codes had the highest unemployment claims in 2020 due to COVID-19 and an unemployment rate that was double the rate in Omaha and Douglas County; and have high concentrations of households that  do not own a vehicle or have the ability to purchase or maintain a vehicle.  Those who reported being unemployed in 2020 in these zip codes were all earning below 100% of the federal poverty level; did not have a high school diploma/GED; were between the ages of 16-44 years; had children under the age of 18; and were primarily Black/African American and American Indian/Alaska Native. These zip codes also have poverty rates that are triple the rate in Omaha and Douglas County and contain a total of 13,957 businesses that are currently hiring and 51 childcare establishments, according to Heartland Workforce Solutions.
The first steps in ENCAP’s project would be completing a feasibility study in order to determine where routes should begin operating, based on both employer and worker needs, and designing a program that meets the requirements of the Nebraska Public Service Commission.  ENCAP will look at such factors as the incidence of workers who have children, but do not own a vehicle and rely on other means of transportation to get to work; of workers with the minimum amount of experience and education required by the most frequently hiring occupations; of available childcare; and of job openings available in the area. ENCAP also will assess the needs of employers in order to determine the transportation strategies best suited to meeting workforce demands. Through this study and subsequent action, ENCAP aims to bridge businesses in need of employees and households in need of stable employment. Improving the connections between workers and employers is essential to building a productive and sustainable workforce, a primary driver of economic progress. 
According to HWS, there are currently 20,894 total job openings in Douglas County. The top three industries with job openings include Health Care/Social Assistance, Accommodation/Food Services, and Administrative Services. With accessible, adequate transportation provided by ENCAP, these industries have an opportunity to improve recruitment and retention by providing customized commuting options to potential employees. 
The ENCAP program will provide a more flexible, efficient means of transportation through door-to-door service that will include not only transportation to work, but also to childcare services to allow employees the freedom to work and advance at their job, and transportation to job training, interviews and other necessary steps to long-term employment that may not coincide with public transit options. ENCAP also will work with education/training providers to develop solutions for students who are unable to begin or continue their education due to transportation barriers.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> ENCAP prides itself on being a learning organization with a culture of continual improvement and innovation. Utilizing many types of evidence, including not only demographic and service information, but also descriptive research studies, financial data, survey statistics, and trends in client satisfaction, we generate credible, relevant, and actionable information about our organizational effectiveness, the outcomes of our programs, and ultimately, the extent to which we are achieving our mission. ENCAP does not begin any service or program unless the expected impact–and the path leading to that impact–is clear.  Led by Nicki Murphy, ENCAP’s Program Design and Evaluation Manager, ENCAP’s research and evaluation activities are rooted in the principles and standards of the Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers and the American Evaluation Association. Ms. Murphy assesses the effectiveness and outcomes, both expected and unanticipated, of all agency programs on a regular basis.  It is imperative that ENCAP adapts what it offers and how it operates to keep up with the fluidity of poverty, and its proposed transportation program expansion illustrates this pursuit. To this end, we conduct comprehensive Community Needs Assessments to identify the current and anticipated needs of people with low incomes in Douglas and Sarpy Counties. In the years between each full needs assessment, we complete interim studies on emerging issues affecting our target population to learn how we can best respond. The 2020 transportation study is one such example, and these activities will continue during the course of the proposed project.  To ensure that the data we collect and the interpretation of that data is not biased, we include research on the effects of poverty that reveal racist structures and systems that perpetuate disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic minorities in poverty across generations. Understanding and presenting these inequities allows ENCAP to pinpoint those most in need of resources and support to inform our own service delivery, and to illustrate the true needs of those most vulnerable in our community to help inform our community partners and legislators as they make decisions with far reaching implications. The responsibility of every Community Action Agency is to adapt what services it provides and how it provides those services in response to direct experience. Having operated its transportation program for the past decade, including the piloting of various work- and education-related transportation services during the past few years, ENCAP understands the strategies and accompanying efforts necessary to launch the transportation project it proposes. Also recognizing that it cannot do its work alone, ENCAP emphasizes the creation of results driven partnerships in order to maximize its resources and broaden its impact. In addition to collaborating with employers, ENCAP’s team will work closely with entities such as Heartland Workforce Solutions, Metro Community College, Metro Area Planning Agency, and peer nonprofit agencies to refine its plan and transportation offerings.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> As an agency subject to rigorous state and federal reporting requirements, ENCAP is well-equipped to measure and report its success via this project. Our short-term outcomes for the expanded transportation program include the number of new accessible transportation resources created,  the number of jobs created with a benefit package, the number of jobs created to increase opportunities for people with low-incomes, The number of individuals who attained a recognized credential, certificate, or degree relating to achievement of educational or vocational skills, the number of unemployed youth who obtain employment to gain skills or income, the number of unemployed adults who obtain living wage employment, the number of unemployed adults who obtain and maintain living wage employment for 90/180 days. Over a longer term, we will partner with local workforce agencies to determine the impact of the program on unemployment rates by zip codes.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> ENCAP evaluates each of its programs to determine if they are contributing to our overall mission and producing measurable, positive changes for low-income individuals and communities. We utilize a standardized system, Results-Oriented Management and Accountability (ROMA), to measure and analyze outcome achievement and communicate the difference we are making in the lives of those we serve. ENCAP’s Program Design & Evaluation Manager, with assistance from the QA & Data Analysis Coordinator, will track progress towards our identified outcomes through quarterly reports from staff in our expanded transportation program and Human Resources department, and administer a survey to clients we transport that confirms their employment status and other impacts of the program.</p>

  <p> The investment of employers in ENCAP’s expanded transportation program is a primary  component of this project. Although difficult to predict, if successful in taking this program to scale, we believe it could attract long-term investment from employers and other entities focused on building long-term economic stability in the community, especially North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Heartland Workforce Solutions: ENCAP’s Executive Director serves on the Board of Heartland Workforce Solutions (HWS); and, as a recipient of Community Service Block Grant (CSBG), ENCAP is a required partner of HWS under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). ENCAP will partner with HWS and the Department of Labor to review the needs of workers and employers and impact of the program.  Metro Community College: ENCAP will include MCC in its feasibility study in order to determine the transportation needs of students, especially those working while furthering their education in order to earn more income. A college degree or certification is an income accelerator, and it will be important to consider the role ENCAP could play in offering routes to and from MCC’s North and South Omaha campuses.   Metro Area Planning Agency: ENCAP will work with MAPA leadership as it creates the structure and routing of its program. MAPA’s expertise and input will be valuable to creating the most effective and efficient program possible.   Nonprofit Peers: ENCAP will work with key nonprofit stakeholders, including but not limited to Heart Ministry Center, Family Housing Advisory Services, North Omaha Community Care Council, Financial Hope Collaborative, Learning Community Centers of North and South Omaha, and others to create a clear picture of the needs of job and career seekers with low incomes, and to coordinate route offerings.   Regional Metropolitan Transit Authority (RMTA) (formerly Metro Transit): ENCAP will build and maintain a healthy relationship with RMTA to work collectively to gauge the barriers to RMTA services that can be addressed by the ENCAP Transportation Program.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> ENCAP has a standing MOU with Heartland Workforce Solutions and, as necessary, it will enter into similar agreements with key stakeholders. In all cases where an employer or nonprofit agency seeks to procure transportation services from ENCAP, a formal contract will be executed.</p>

  <h3>DesignEstimatingBiddingCostsDetermined</h3>
  <p> Design was estimated and is in the budget. The Construction contractor told us to estimate 6-8% percent of the construction budget. I estimated at 8% to account for incidentals or changes. The construction bid was from JE Dunn construction company. They came onsite, used the property measurements to determine estimated construction costs. The rest of the costs were estimated based on our known costs related to our current transportation program.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Yes. We seek to create employer-sponsored transportation services. Per the pro forma submitted, we project to achieve fiscal sustainability by year 4. Costs rise annually for any program, so ENCAP aims to continue creating new employer partnerships and incrementally increasing rates over time to meet cost demands.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> We will secure contracts with employers to support expanded transportation services. In addition, we will continue to explore new private and public funding opportunities that support this work. ENCAP’s Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) funding is a flexible funding source targeted to reducing the causes and conditions of poverty in the community. Beyond the project period, ENCAP will determine if and when application of CSBG funding is necessary to sustain this program.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> This proposal is scalable. Vehicle availability, the infrastructure to support vehicle upkeep and maintenance, security of assets, and adequate parking are the most significant factors to the success of a transportation program. Once ENCAP secures these with economic recovery funding, it will be able to begin and expand operations on a gradual basis as needed. If more limited funding is offered, ENCAP could offer a scaled down version of the program; however, creating transformational change demands that are able to offer as broad a service as possible.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> ENCAP has a strong track record of being a highly reliable and effective steward of public funding. As we heard at the Omaha Economic Recovery Public Hearings, recipients of ARPA funding must have the capacity to spend the ARPA funding they receive on a consistent basis, collect the necessary data about their work and outcomes, and meet reporting requirements. We are confident that ENCAP is unique among applicants in its ability to do so.  We do not currently have the financial resources to fund this expansion of the ENCAP Transportation Program without this influx of funding from ARPA funds, however, we will continue to support the infrastructure needed to support the program and pursue meaningful commitments from existing and potential funders.</p>
