  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Other
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> We will offer funding support of new startups and job creation in technical fields through partnerships with local affiliates and venture funds</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Sustainable Community
- With the Academy initially positioned in one of the Qualified Census Tracts (and the ability to scale to other QCTs) our educational programs will be curated to best meet the immediate needs of the community when it comes to creating new businesses and jobs. We will guide an individual from their initial idea for a startup to a product, and several will eventually scale into a true company creating many new jobs.  

Policy
- Our curriculum will focus on foundational founder knowledge, how to build an initial MVP, requirements in a business model, and what to look for when hiring a team. We will help founders better understand their financials, go-to-market strategies, and strategies for acquiring customers.
One of the most powerful programs will focus on what it takes to fundraise in Nebraska. Learning how to apply for grants, raise private equity, and work with banks to fund your idea will create transformation and long-lasting economic growth.  

Other
- Our partnership with MOVE Venture Capital will give these underrepresented founders access to capital opportunities that have traditionally been challenging to acquire for founders in North and South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Nebraska Startup Academy directly addresses multiple gaps within the Sustainable Community Needs and Policy Needs. The Academy’s main focus is to level up Nebraska entrepreneurship by directly educating our communities on the general business requirements needed to create a startup, and how to scale a technology business thus creating more jobs in the area. Our programs will range from current founders and eventually to our youth.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Academy will create a fundamental change in the way Nebraskans (specifically those located in North and South Omaha) think about long-lasting economic growth through the creation of scalable new businesses with higher-paying jobs. This transformational shift can be easily scaled and replicated in different areas of the city.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We anticipate the Academy will directly help create and support ~60 new startups in the next three years. Startups at this stage, within three years typically bring on five-twenty new jobs. We conservatively anticipate 300+ full time jobs (many technical) within the first three years. These jobs typically start in the $55,000-$70,000 range with the opportunity to grow into much higher paying jobs.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 300+ new jobs within three years</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 50+ interns and contractors within three years</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> $55,000-70,000</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> The academy will help upskill individuals to fill immediate needs by partnering with local affiliates and bringing curriculum to the Qualified Census Tracts.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Academy will provide educational opportunities for individuals to create their own businesses with a focus on technology as well as upskill individuals to be able to apply for tech-focused jobs.  

More technology-based jobs, with their higher income, has an opportunity to improve local neighborhoods and the economic support for the community

Proximity to education, skills, and opportunities will provide those currently living in the local neighborhood new opportunities that don’t currently exist today</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> New companies in the community will create new jobs and attract talent from other parts of the city to commute to North and South Omaha driving additional economic growth.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Academy will be innovative in the way it works directly with the venture funds in Nebraska to assist founders in raising capital for their pre-seed and seed rounds at their startup –  We will work with local affiliates to drive talent to local technical assistance companies – The Academy will educate on how to leverage existing grants</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Number of new companies created –  Number of new high-wage, technology jobs created –  Attendance at education sessions –  Completion and implementation of curriculum –  Diversity of individuals attending the academy</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> We will track and report these metrics internally and publicly and directly share reports as needed</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, as new startups scale there will be opportunities for those in the community to co-invest or take advantage of secondary investments – In year 3 the Academy will offer educational programs focused on private investment best practices</p>
