  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> La Casa Del Pueblo's South Omaha Bakery Re-Entry Project represents the leading edge of entrepreneurship designed to change lives. It will establish honored South Omaha business Johnny's Cafe as its hub, since Johnny's is renting out the space to house this initiative.  Candidates for training to become a professional baker will come from Generation Diamond, Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition, and Metro Community College. We are currently seeking a master baker from the pool of candidates available at Metro's Culinary Department. After a six-month training program, we endeavor to rotate out the trainees to established restaurants and bakeries in the area. Further, we plan on repairing and utilizing Generation Diamond's lunch truck to serve as an outlet for our baked goods, and eventually utilize Johnny's to help us prepare sandwiches (on our bread, of course!) for sale from the truck. The truck and all the responsibility that goes with it -- licensing, permits, locations permissions, etc. -- becomes another training grounds for the future of our trainees. The truck will function as our remote mini-store, and every trainee will rotate into both the bakery side and the truck side of training. 

The program will be housed in the bskery and break room of Johnny's Cafe at 27th and L, just a few blocks from Generation Diamond.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> The timeline is attached.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The bakery we propose offers real time education that impacts workforce development (probably 20 candidates per year) in culinary baking, which is a valued and sustainable artisan skill in Latino communities. Further, it will offer the expansion of food availability to people within its reach. This clearly enhances the quality of life in the community that can visibly demonstrate an ethos of "plenty for all," which is part of the value system we hope to promote. Finally, we seek to make it easier for more persons in our community to become successful food vendors. We will identify and make known both hindrances and helps in that area.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal places our training proposed bakery in the middle of (using the worshop findings language) "a thriving small business community." We hope to become a valued partner in that community by training up the next been nurtured and encouraged through our community, and strengthen the local economy through our part in developing a strengthened workforce of excellence through a minimum of 20 Culinary Baking re-entry graduates.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024 addresses the need to correct unfavorable perceptions of our community. The owners of Johnny's Cafe are granting us an opportunity to advance a cadre of young adults into positions of respect through their support of the pathway to living-wage jobs. The image of young adults parked forever on a sidewalk stoop wasting time can change quickly of the broader Omaha community sees  success in action in our Latino neighborhoods. It may be one of the best ways to overcom those negatibve perceptions, in fact.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Our current plans seek to graduate some 20 students annually (half every six months). The number could increase dramatically, however, as the bakert training matures.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 18-20 annually.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Unknown at present</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Trained entry-level bakers usually start in the $20 - $22 per hour range.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> We are already pursuing partnerships with other like-minded organizations, as well as finding business partners within and bordering our QCT.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The community benefits as the bakery is establihed and grows, Citizens will benefit from the provision of staple baked goods at a very competitive price. Young adults might consider baking as a trade to learn and earn a living wage from it, which brings more economic stability to the community. Further, the area around Johnny's Cafe will enjoy some sprucing up.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Keeping Johnny's Cafe a vital part of South Omaha is a clear benefit of this approach. It not only honors the history of a family that loves our community and supports it regularly, but also breathes new life into the community to benefit many such long-standing family businesses. It promises a sense of community continuity in a culture steeped in tradition and innovation.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The idea of a culinary training institute itself is not new to Omaha. But the idea and practice of utilizing the need to build the community workforce through a program that can become self-funding is one that deserves attention. This project is not only hitting the ground with more than one distribution channel (the store, the truck, and more channels to come), it also demonstrates innovation by teaching customer priority through the offering of distinct product that they can learn to love. A Latino bakery and coffee truck on my commute to work? Over a lunch break? It deserves a try, at the very least.?</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> We will utilize a retention-measuring tool that will give us clear ideas of what parts of the training are strongest. We also will conduct a blind survey of graduates' starting wages on the job. We will also use a good njumber of customer satisfaction survey to evaluate and improve products.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Outcomes will be measured by teaching staff and the leadership team members, perhaps with the help of consultants on occasion.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes. We seek catalytic arrangements to encourage co-investment and secondary investment to keep our product lines fresh.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>

  <h3>Displacement</h3>
