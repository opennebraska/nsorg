  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The proposal supports our organizational goals by identifying what the community currently needs in a company and what we are looking for in employees. Kayla and Stephanie were actively involved with recruiting for medical facilities during the COVID 19 Pandemic. We witness the impact on the damage COVID 19 did to lower income communities specifically. We will be as competitive as possible with our infrastructure and employee benefits. For example, work from home options two days per week, flexible hours that would still equate to a 40-hour work week, and a competitive commission structure for all applicable positions. As a company, we want to offer financial freedom for all our employees which is why the minimum salary would be $50,000 per year.</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Mahogany Staffing is a healthcare staffing company that provides travel assignments to healthcare professionals. Specifically, Mahogany Staffing works with CNAs, LPNs, RNs, and Allied Health Professionals. There is a large demand for CNAs, LPNs, RNs, and Allied Health Professionals who are willing to travel and care for patients. In Nebraska alone, the demand for such workers will increase by 80% from 2020 to 2030. Thus, the estimated number of potential clients within our immediate area is 1,696,386. Mahogany Staffing’s goal is to provide outstanding, individualized care by assigning healthcare professionals to long-term care facilities, clinics, and hospitals all over the country. 

Within the first year, we expect to: 


•	Purchase a building outside of the original travel nursing hub to open a new market
•	Obtain three vendors such as FocusOne, Grapetree, and Primetime
•	Appoint 100 healthcare workers to various healthcare facilities across the Omaha metro area as well as the United States. 

We are currently scouting two locations: The Carnation Ballroom on 24th and Lake and 2215 Harney St. We anticipate that this venture will have a large impact on the local economy, creating over 100 travel and permanent positions within Mahogany Staffing. We will partner with local vendors to expand outreach and establish new connections.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> In January/February, we will make great strides in establishing and launching Mahogany Staffing. In the upcoming year, Mahogany Staffing anticipates an award notification letter. We will also obtain our Federal and State Tax ID numbers, along with our business license in January. In the same month, we will finalize our insurance coverage and open a business bank account. Finally, we are planning to reach out to marketing experts and lay the groundwork to launch our proposal. 

From February 2023 to June 2023, Mahogany Staffing will finalize our hiring process. We are seeking to hire an accountant and send offer letters to all staff. During this time, Mahogany Staffing will acquire staffing licenses in all states, purchase office supplies, and acquire vendors along with direct contracts. Finally, we will set up compliance, payroll, and marketing needs. 

Throughout 2023 and into 2024 Mahogany Staffing will focus on building our infrastructure. We will also focus on our 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-day goals.</p>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal addresses community needs by offering a minimum base salary of $50,000 in addition to a competitive bonus structure which in turn would help with the quality of life and help build a more sustainable community. We will implement a work life balance for employees and hold events within the community to educate and come together as one. We will also maintain transparency to gain trust within the community. We also plan to hold food drives to help with the food insecurities within North and South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Mahogany Staffing will be a start-up located in QCT 11 or QCT19. We will employ North and South Omaha residents and provide them with a livable wage which would stymy the current economic hardships faced by many in this area. COVID 19 left many without jobs and many more with salary cuts. Our commitment is to pay each of our employees a minimum salary of $50,000. Additionally, we will also pay a commission structure to all applicable employees. Our Healthcare Recruiters, whom we refer to as Recruiting Specialists, will earn between $72,148 and $91,906 based on their experience. This, according to salary.com, is the lowest to highest salary that a Nurse Recruiter can expect in the U.S. This would significantly raise the median household income for many in QCT 11 or QCT19, which would in turn help with food insecurities, affordability for more reliable transportation and all around a better quality of life.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Mahogany Staffing is committed to raising the median household income while achieving long-lasting economic growth in North and South Omaha. To achieve this, we’ve pledged to pay our employees a minimum starting salary of $50,000 a year. We pledge to volunteer within North and South Omaha QCTs and hold healthcare related seminars and services. Mahogany staffing will also be listed as a Training Center for American Heart Association; which would allow certain Mahogany Staffing employees to teach Basic Life Support classes. We will also host food drives and free healthcare related educational festivals with food and fun.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> This proposal will create roughly 120 permanent jobs by the end of our first fiscal year. This would include in house staff members that carry out roles vital to the company, i.e Recruiting Specialist ($50,000), Client Development Specialist ($50,000) and Credentialing Specialist ($50,000). In addition to the salaries, the Recruiting Specialist and the Client Development Specialist will get a competitive commission structure (attached in the budget). Travel wages for CNA, LPN, RN, and Allied Healthcare Professionals are complex. The blended rate (Includes taxable and non-taxable income) for a CNA would be roughly $28/hour, LPN would be roughly $40/hour, RN would be roughly $75/hour, and Allied Health Professional would make roughly $50/hour.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> By the end of year 3, we are estimating to have 330 employees. Of these 330 employees, 300 would be travel C.N.As, LPNs, RN, and Allied Healthcare professionals.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> This proposal will create temporary and construction jobs if we choose the Carnation Ballroom as a QCT 11 remodel project.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Our business is committed to providing employees with a livable wage. Therefore, each employee will have a salary that is equal to or greater than $50,000 a year. Recruiting/Client Development/Credentialing Specialist will receive $50,000 a year. Manager positions across these three departments will receive $75,000 a year. Finally, the Payroll Specialist and IT Specialist will have $55,000.00 a year salary.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Mahogany Staffing will provide immediate job opportunities for North/South Omaha residents. Locals can apply for our entry level positions. These jobs pay $50,000 a year salary and do not require a college degree. Thus, making them easily accessible for diverse backgrounds.   By being in North/South Omaha, we are easily accessible for current healthcare workers who are looking for a new job that better fits their family needs.  Additionally, we would provide temporary employment for contractors in the area. We are currently in the process of securing a new office space. Once obtained, Mahogany Staffing would hire contractors for any repair needed. The company would seek out a business in the Qualified Census Tracts to support businesses in North and South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> This proposal will increase livability in the local community. We are willing to create new economic growth attached to salaries that normally require a bachelor’s degree at minimum with 1 year experience. We acknowledge the gap in the economy that not everyone is able to obtain a college degree but can still perform at a high level to complete the same job functions. Essentially, the recruiting specialist and Client Development Specialist will need to have a customer service background as the main requirement. Any knowledge needed aside from that is coachable and learned over time with experience with our 60-day on the job training program.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal would contribute to quality of life through sustainable wages and economic stability throughout QCT11 or QCT19. Through this grant, our company would achieve continued economic growth which would allow us to give back to the community. In the future, we seek to partner with local charities, such as the Malcolm X Foundation, CASA, WCA, Charles Drew Health Center, and NOAH Clinic. Furthermore, our commitment to paying employees a minimum salary of $50,000 and a competitive commission structure would provide a higher standard of living for residents and their families.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The concept of travel nursing has existed since the mid-1800s. In 1854, Florence Nightingale and 38 fellow nurses travel to the Ottoman Empire (now modern-day Turkey) to treat wounded soldiers battling against the Russian Empire. Mahogany Staffing is proud to continue this tradition. Currently, North and South Omaha does not have a large Travel Staffing company related to healthcare. With the networking and connections, we have available to put in place, we will hit the ground running. This is an untapped, multi-billion-dollar industry that could bring about a massive change in North and South Omaha’s healthcare infrastructure.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The outcomes of our proposal are as follows:    •	First and foremost, Mahogany Staffing will create jobs at a base salary of $50,000. Applicants do not need to possess a college degree. Staffing roles at Mahogany will be filled based on applicants’ previous experiences, skill, and attributes.  •	Mahogany Staffing will provide Basic Life Support classes through American Heart Association. These classes are available to all employees regardless of travel status at no cost to them.  •	Mahogany Staffing will partner with the Malcolm X Foundation, CASA, WCA, Charles Drew Health Center, and Noah Clinic for sponsorship of health and education community events.  •	Common knowledge of general healthcare •	Providing a platform to inspire other minority owned businesses •	Bringing business to a lower income area of the city  •	Providing an attraction to the city where new growth is lacking</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> These can be measured by providing retention rates not only within Mahogany but other businesses in the area as well. Aiding existing businesses to expand and attract new businesses to the area. Helping to maintain new growth within the city, particularly North and South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> This proposal would act as a catalyst for secondary investments in the future to open a potential second location. Alternatively, Mahogany Staffing might move into a larger building due to the continued growth of the company and the need for more room.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
