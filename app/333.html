  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> DC will leverage capacity development, finance, and training, with the LB1024 award and fundraising requests providing first seed support. The alignment with the project through the founders' leadership and board structure, DC will encourage diversity and inclusion for all persons with developmental disabilities in the workplace. More cooperation will occur among the personnel as they design and get grant-funded training. Our company would want to focus on two areas of leadership: aid with the next stage of engagement and building, and best practices advice through NAM. The next stage will be to construct our own training and development center so that we can prepare the essential skills before arriving on site. The curriculum is more substantial than at the café site, with a focus on behavioral and life skills development.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Yes, the project is planned for an existing space refurbishment (see attached pro-forma), but it is adaptable to redevelopment in the identified OCT regions in North and South Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Yes, Destiny has identified creating their strategic tracking report with the outline and guidelines of LB1024</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> DC recognizes the challenges that minorities, refugees, and immigrants experience and prepare them to be strong leaders in the café. The skills taught are rewarded with certification, which may be utilized to enhance their careers while they look for full-time work. Nebraska's restaurant business is understaffed. Destiny Cafe intends to alter that for the better. The three basic goals of DC are to understand differently abled minority perspectives and context, establish coalitions to make an influence, and manage challenges to the change process. As a result, equality is critical, and each future leader must commit to a strategy that fosters the creation of a more equitable society. The training in this program will be used to develop the Three-Tier Model for Success. The Destiny Café approach is comprised of three components: training, certification, and aid in securing rewarding job in their chosen sector. Omaha programs are necessary to produce leaders of color. People with developmental impairments who have sought for work at least once in the last year have a 33.5% unemployment rate. Poverty affects more than 20% of Americans with developmental impairments. With an unemployment rate of 82%, there are 1.2 million persons in the United States who can execute easy occupations. DC will lead this group and develop skills that will be critical to their success in elevating future leaders of color.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> DC advocates for the rights and duties of those who face the stereotype that those who are not neurotypical do not make contributions to society. Devlovemntly delayed Minorities, refugees, and immigrants endure prejudice and stigma in the community, which may be exacerbated if they are neurodiverse. These organizations must be prepared to cope with the personnel shortfall that is affecting our Omaha neighborhoods' diners, cafés, and small commercial food companies. The three major goals of DC are to manage change process issues, comprehend minority viewpoints and circumstances, and establish coalitions to persuade neurotypicals who can be added as productive workers at DC and in the wider Omaha community advocating equality. Because equity is so crucial, every future leader must commit to developing a more equitable society. The expanding DC pilot program's training will be used to construct the Three-Tier Model for Success. The three components of the DC idea are training, certification, and aid in finding a rewarding career in a person's desired field (placement). Because the unemployment rate for persons with developmental disabilities who have sought for job at least once in the last year in Omaha is now 33.5%, programs are necessary to build leaders of color who can. Poverty affects more than 20% of Americans with developmental impairments. There are 1.2 million persons in the United States who can do fundamental tasks, yet they have an unemployment rate of 82%. As a result, DC's leadership of this group will raise future leaders of color by acquiring skills critical to their success and improved quality of life.</p>
