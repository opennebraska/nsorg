  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> A business ecosystem is a purposeful business arrangement between two or more entities that work together to create and share collective value for a common set of customers.   Every business ecosystem has participants, whether orchestrators or participants, where all participants have a collective responsibility to support the ecosystem while having their brands present in the value propositions offered.  The Public Health Innovation Ecosystem is a model that promotes innovation, technology, and collaboration to prepare Nebraska public health & public safety professionals & organizations to find digital solutions to address and mitigate priority public health issues and challenges - together.  The Public Health Innovation Ecosystem consists of local participants (consumers, businesses, government agencies, and non-profit groups) who serve customers in minority & disadvantaged communities in Nebraska experiencing major public health challenges & have needs for digital technological products and services to enhance public health detection, testing, & treatment.  The aim of the Public Health Innovation Ecosystem is to enhance the support & resources provided to minority & disadvantaged communities in North & South Omaha, with the goal of expanding & scaling our resources to increase the quality of life and economic health for minority & disadvantaged communities across Nebraska. 
To successfully develop this ecosystem, nine (9) core organization structural components are necessary:  
1.	ECOSYSTEM GOVERNANCE – all ecosystem partners will be required to have an organization member serve on the Ecosystem Governance Committee.  The role of the committee is to exert influence without formal power, make & execute key ecosystem decisions, and adapting internal governance processes to accommodate for ecosystem dynamics.
Based on the roles & responsibilities, partners will be disseminated & broken into one of four subcategories: 
2.	SERVICES PROVIDERS – organizations responsible for providing training, coaching, procurement, technical assistance, networking or other wraparound services to help businesses meet their customer and services needs;
3.	CAPITAL PROVIDERS - organizations responsible for deploying and distributing capital directly to small businesses. Types of capital include, but not limited to: debt, equity, and grants;
4.	INNOVATORS - organizations responsible for identifying and supporting new technological offerings and products to provide small businesses with research, data and insights to help businesses thrive;
5.	CAPACITY BUILDERS - organizations responsible for building skills and capability of  operators, helping implement system enhancements, providing quality assurance of programs and elevating best practice;
6.	FUNDERS - organizations responsible for administering and aggregating funding for ecosystem program and initiative delivery;
7.	CONVENERS - organizations responsible for creating platforms to organize, collaborate, and solve pressing issues; serve as a thought partner and foster connections for system improvements;
8.	ADVOCATES - organizations responsible for advancing local small business priorities by spreading awareness for policies, protections, and legislation;
9.	INVESTIGATORS - organizations responsible for researching and sharing learnings to inform collective understanding, priorities and actions within the ecosystem.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The Public Health Innovation Ecosystem is a new organization comprised of a collaborative, multi-disciplinary mix of community partners who work & practice in areas of public health and public safety in Omaha, Nebraska.  This is the first initiative this particular group of partners have organized to implement.  Individually all of our partners have years of experience that highlight completed projects & major accomplishments; however, this collaborative ecosystem is a network of partnerships who work together to foster & develop new technology that is ideal to fit the needs of disadvantaged communities within Nebraska.  
Our overall goal together is to collaboratively develop solutions that increase & enhance the efforts of the public health and public safety providers that serve them on local and state level.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Social determinants of health, or the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, have a substantial impact on an individual’s health.  In general, individuals with higher incomes and education levels report better health outcomes.  Before COVID-19, minority & disadvantaged communities in Nebraska were disproportionately underrepresented and lacking access to resources necessary to reduce disease burden, decrease social determinants of health, & improve quality of health.  After COVID 19, the lasting impact of COVID-19 is projected to be experienced the most in communities of color – especially in Nebraska.  Before, during, & after COVID-19, state & community health organizations have been ill equipped to sustain successes as they address the complex health threats we face today - including the morbidity and mortality associated with persistent chronic diseases, mental illness, and emerging infectious diseases that will increase as a result of COVID-19.   
To be better prepared for the current state of minority health & the inevitable next pandemic in Nebraska, we must improve the built environment, broaden and deepen the social safety net, and ensure that everyone has access to the health resources they need in order to flourish.  Therefore, we propose the development of a Public Health Innovation Ecosystem. The Ecosystem will focus on these priorities: 
•	Innovation: Creates a standard of the future of healthcare through a focus on streamlining & enhancing public health practice through the development of technology, & 
•	Ecosystem: Supports cross-collaboration and aligns current social-purpose business ventures to develop economic-driven, public health-based technology & enhancements 

The Public Health Innovation Ecosystem is a model that promotes innovation, technology, and collaboration to prepare Nebraska to find solutions together.  The aim of the ecosystem is to support disadvantaged communities in Nebraska and support local & statewide goals including increased quality of life and economic health by creating a system that identifies & detects priority public health problems, trains Public Health Outreach Specialists to address the problems, and utilize Public Health Outreach Specialists to develop tangible technological solutions.  
With a focus to use technology to eliminate health disparities & increase social determinants of health of the  minority & disadvantaged communities of North and South Omaha, our Public Health Innovation Ecosystem  can serve as a scalable process for disease prevention and economic sustainability.  We forecast our ecosystem can create over 600 Public Health Outreach Specialists jobs, decrease mental illness, chronic disease & social determinants of health, and create organic economic stability for North & South Omaha over the next 10 years.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Our Public Health Technological Outreach Ecosystem involves 3 key steps: 
1.	Identifying priority public health issues within the community, 
2.	Training Public Health Outreach Specialists to design technology-based solutions for the identified problems, and; 
3.	3. Nurture & grow technological solutions for larger usage.  
Our ecosystem model projects that each year we can host community engagement interactions that identifies key public health priority problems, where 15 problems can be used to develop technological prototypes, and 3 prototypes are advanced into larger-business oriented systems.  To produce these results, on-going training & support towards the development of competent Public Health Outreach Specialists will be conducted year-round.  However, the following timeline can be used to identify annual activity: (Below I would break this out in Quarters such as Q1 2023 Q1 2023…etc…
•	Quarter 1: January: Ecosystem partners convene to discuss and identify the overall strategic plan.  Also during this period, new Public Health Outreach Specialists are identified and trained for public health & innovation-based technical certifications.  
•	Quarter 2: Once training begins, outreach workers will engage with community members through partner organizations to identify 15 priority public health problems.  Public Health Outreach Specialists will develop technology-based minimum viable products that demonstrate potential solutions to the identified public health problems.  During this phase, products are tested and validated by Public Health Outreach Specialists and presented to the Ecosystem Committee.  
•	Quarter 3: The Ecosystem Committee will meet and vote on the top 3 products that will be further developed. Based on the Ecosystem Committee vote, startup businesses will be developed to support future growth of the top 3 products.  Public Health Outreach Specialists & ecosystem partner organizations will work together to develop the teams & infrastructure necessary to further test & validate the startup business structure and technology.  
•	Quarter 4: An annual conference and fundraiser will be hosted to showcase the Public Health Outreach Specialists the new public health technology, and discuss key action steps for the new year.  
In order to accomplish this goal, our first 2 years will be focused on seizing the market opportunity, developing competent Public Health Outreach Specialists, and developing  the infrastructure to build, support, & grow new analytic & digital technology solutions.  Years 3-5 will focus on evolving the ecosystem model and developing a system that identifies and produce cutting-edge public health technology.  Years 5-10 will be focused locking in key ecosystem to work to scale our model state & region wide and developing a sustainable and profitable digital ecosystem.  

Our goal for the ecosystem is to develop a sustainable framework that works to enhance and elevate current direct public health services and integrate collaborative efforts to allow for more strategic, impactful, individual-centric public health solutions.  In the next 5 – 10 years, our milestones include developing a collaborative method for disease prevention & preparedness for future health-related crisis, developing technology that decreases disease & social determinants of health, and developing public health & public safety-based businesses that increases jobs and economic stability in the same communities we focus to increase the overall quality of life. By this period, the Public Health Innovation Ecosystem will have generated a large, organic audience aggregation of community members utilizing the technology produced.  Through focus on developing digital public health solutions for high usage & engagement, digital purchases & subscriptions sold from our aggregated audience will financially support the further ecosystem sustainability, and the state and region wide scaling of our ecosystem.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Public Health Innovation Ecosystem  is a model that promotes innovation, technology, and collaboration to prepare minority and disadvantaged communities within Nebraska to find solutions together through sustainable community efforts that work to increase overall quality of life.  The goal of the ecosystem is to make public health services relating to chronic disease, mental illness & social determinants of health more readily available via digital means to help contribute to the reduction of disease & increase financial inclusion in disadvantaged communities. 
The focus of this ecosystem is to utilize partnerships and collaborations to provide a multi-disciplinary approach to disease treatment and prevention to provide greater support for disadvantaged communities and community members within North and South Omaha.  Through use of this health innovation ecosystem initiative, we can collaboratively create  a multi-level influence on health behaviors through use of partnerships to foster and develop new technology that is ideal to fit the needs of disadvantaged communities within Nebraska and to increase & enhance the efforts of the public health and public safety providers that serve them on local and state level.  
By supporting the development of a Public Health Innovation Ecosystem , we can collectively create an economic-driven system that works to detect, test, treat, and prevent the diseases and illnesses most impacted & accelerated by COVID-19. With implementation over the next 5 – 10 years, we can forecast an increase in the ability to:
•	Attract and retain talent, enhance skill and professional development;
•	Develop a statewide conduit focused on reduced health disparities & positive behavior change; 
•	Reduce factors related to poor social determinants of health and health disparities;
•	Provide enhanced solutions for disease detection, testing, and treatment;
•	Use real-time data to develop more focused strategies for disease & illness prevention
•	Use real-time data to increase preparedness and response to health crisis,
•	Provide adequate resources that work to increase health equity and equality, and;
•	Reduce the economic burden of public health outreach & treatment services.
By full support and implementation of the Public Health Innovation Ecosystem, we can predict in the next 5-10 years that we will be able to successfully reduce the disease and illness that result in the largest cause of death within the State of Nebraska by 35% (did you state somewhere the largest cause of death in NE- this would be a good specific metric to put in).  This will in turn reduce the overall economic burden of disease, increase collaborative impact & response to emergency & safety, increase initiatives focused on public health growth and sustainability and increase the overall quality of life for minority & disadvantaged communities throughout the State of Nebraska.  In addition, by implementing our ecosystem for the next 10 years, we forecast this initiative to create over 30 new businesses, over 600 new high wage jobs, and an economic impact over $1 Billion within the minority & disadvantage communities.</p>

  <p> The Public Health Innovation Ecosystem ’s aim is to create a framework that consistently identifies and turn priority community health problems into business ideas developed through validated proof of concepts that can be accelerated into business opportunities & scalable technology that stimulate the growth and success of the North and  South Omaha communities – providing technological solutions that decrease community-level health disparities and increase environmental social determinants of health. This in turn, creates new jobs, diversifies the industrial base, increases positive innovative opportunities, increase economic development, and enhances the quality of life in minority & disadvantages communities in North and South Omaha, and across the State of Nebraska.    The outcomes of this ecosystem include (but not limited to):  1.	Creating and implementing pooled-resources, skill development & training activities to enhance community capacity; 2.	Identify priority community problems to provide support and research that generates groundbreaking technology that, in turn, generates economic value; 3.	Provide multi-disciplinary opportunities to attract & grow Nebraska’s professional talent; 4.	Develop a network that helps translate fundamental public health research into the industrial marketplace, and; 5.	Scale public health innovation from the local to national level – improving the quality of life for all Nebraskans & minority & disadvantaged communities internationally;  6.	Develop a network that is skilled & prepared to mitigate future health threats for all levels of the community.  7.	Creates a databank of fundamental public health data that can be used to improve & enhance health improvement strategies for the community & community members   Once technological systems have been validated to produce & sustain the listed outcomes, the ecosystem model can be scaled state & region wide  to support other minority & disadvantaged communities.</p>
