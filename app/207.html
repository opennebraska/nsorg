  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Great Plains Black History Museum is looking to build a new facility that will help attract thousands back to the 24th and lake area.  As such, the new building would create an estimated $64 million impact on the Omaha economic community in the first five years of operation. The museum estimates that approximately 65,000 visitors would walk through the doors the first year, with 19,500 of them coming from out of town. The estimated annual new Tourism Revenue Direct Impact would be $1.7 million. Allowing Omaha and the state of Nebraska to tap into the $40 billion annual market of African American tourism and generate a positive, measurable return on investment to the Omaha community and the state.  The location that the Great Plains Black History Museum looks to erect its new facility is the two to three empty lots located between the Webster Telephone Exchange Building 2213 Lake Street, Omaha, NE 68110 and The Union for Contemporary Art 2423 North 24th Street, Omaha, NE 68110, community development.

  <p> Key reason for the support of the building a new museum is purely economic. On the national scene, African Americans spend billions of dollars on tourism every year. Currently, Omaha and the state of Nebraska capture very few of those dollars. The Great Plains Black History Museum has worked to develop a vision for an Arts, Culture, History and Entertainment facility for the district along 24h and Lake, an area where some of the greatest entertainers in the world once played providing the opportunity to connect a rich history to a thriving future. New stores, art galleries, music venues and housing developments are starting to spring up in the area and large-scale community festivals are beginning to attract thousands back to the 24th and lake area. When the powerful vision of the Great Plains Black History Museum is achieved Omaha and the state of Nebraska will be able to tap into the $40 billion market of African American tourism and generate a positive, measurable return on investment.
Over the past ten years, the Empowerment Network has survey and polled over 3,000 Omaha residents and leaders regarding important issues, recommendations, solutions and priorities. Consistently, when asked about the top priorities in the areas of arts, culture, history and entertainment, the Great Plains Black History Museum places number one or two in the ranking process. People of all ages are interested in the dynamic and compelling history of African Americans in the city of Omaha and state of Nebraska.

The estimated annual new Tourism Revenue Direct Impact would be $1.7 million. 
One of the most vital reasons for investing in the Great Plains Black History Museum is the education of African American and other children. When children understand and appreciate their history, they are more empowered and encouraged to achieve. They are provided historical role models that emphasize the importance of education and the spirit of overcoming. Rather than only learning about their ancestors as just slaves, students will have the opportunity to learn about African American leaders, trailblazers, legends and innovators from Nebraska, the Great Plains, and throughout the United States that truly impacted the nation and world. Students of all races will benefit by learning a more complete history.  The Museum can be an educational resource for our local higher education institutes, Creighton University, University of Nebraska at Omaha and Metropolitan Community College.
The Outdoor Event Area and Meeting Area
The Museum grounds and facilities will include a landscaped outdoor event area for seasonal events, outdoor performances, student, school and community recognition events.  This outdoor event area can also be rented for family reunions, picnics and corporate events.  A circular enclosed picnic and play area accessible from the Changing Gallery is also available for private events and reunions.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Great Plains Black History Museum will use state of the art Museum innovation to make a once invisible history visible: Holograms, interactive exhibits and technology to tell American History through the lens of African Americans.  The Museum will also have its own Archival Resource Center that will use best practices and innovation to main its collection of historic photos, letters, news clippings, artwork, and other records.  The priceless archival collection will be recorded on digital files which can be made available at computer stations in the Museum, and on-line to students, educators, and scholars so this heritage can be preserved for future generations.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> As the only Museum in the state of Nebraska focused on American History told through the lens of African Americans, the Great Plains Black History Museum can have a greater impact on educating all students and adult learners of the rich history of African Americans.  The Great Plains Black History Museum is a primary source for educating students on African American history. When students understand and appreciate their history, they are more empowered and encouraged to achieve. The Great Plains Black History Museum provides students with historical role models that emphasize the importance of education and the spirit of overcoming.

Students of all races will benefit by learning a more complete history.  The Museum can be an educational resource for our local higher education institutes, Creighton University, University of Nebraska at Omaha and Metropolitan Community College. As with Joslyn Art Museum, the Durham Museum, Omaha Children’s Museum there are various management and leadership positions required to have a successful organization we believe the a new facility for the Great Plains Black History Museum will create opportunities for additional management and leadership positions, which will create internships, entry level, medium, and high-wage jobs.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Measurable outcomes will be measured by the number of guests who visit the Museum, revenue generated through the gift shop/bookstore, and coffee shop.  The number of employees that the Museum employs Museum annual and lifetime memberships.  These outcomes will be measured by the Museum and will be made available to outside sources upon request.</p>
