  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> This proposal is for funding a Safe House (transitional Home). Queens Butterfly House will be a 501 (c)3. The goal of this proposal is to allow Queens Butterfly House to purchase a home and provide safe, affordable, and stable housing for women returning from incarceration to the North Omaha metro area. Queens Butterfly will provide Various cognitive classes such as Thinking for a change, Moral recognition therapy, and 7 Habits of a highly effective woman. Queens butterfly is a part of the Safe House Network reentry project created by Ms. Susan Burton in Los Angeles California. I am currently a Reentry specialist for The Rise Academy. Which means I have a connection with many of the ladies currently. I have also been working with Rosalyn Cotton Parole Board Chair on the elements of what makes for a successful safe Home. Queens is on a Quest for Understanding, Educating, and Empowering Nobel Sistahs. By allowing these ladies to live Holistically into becoming the best version of themselves. My dream is to place Queens in North Omaha to 1. bring up the property value in the community by beatifying and maintaining the property. 2. Have a home for these returning citizens to have access to transportation, Heartland Workforce Center, and Metropolitan Community College. Queens has plans to collaborate with Metro to provide education in each lady's field of choice. I have also spoken with and will collaborate with the Nebraska Department of Corrections which will provide a small grant to each individual that may be indigent. This grant will only cover the first 90 days of a resident's stay. After which time they will pay 30% of their income for rent with $500 being the maximum. As a formerly incarcerated individual who was once part of the problem, I know that I am closest to the solution. My qualifications extend further than my lived experience. I am currently a Social Work/Criminology student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha as well. I want to be able to not just show but to explain the steps of reentry to each lady through holistic support and by holding them accountable for themselves. Queens brings it's own supportive staff via the Safe House Network.</p>
