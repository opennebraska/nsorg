  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Our mission is to deploy fiber, wireless internet, and CBRS LTE technologies on (8) towers in North, South and West Omaha, to decrease the digital divide by connecting the unconnected.
Media King Communication’s goal is to provide free affordable high-speed broadband internet access in QCT’s, to unserved and underserved Nebraskans who have been directly impacted by COVID-19. Furthermore, to build computer labs in all (11) OHA towers; to develop and implement digital literacy programming to those in qualified census tracks, North, South, & West Omaha.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Our fiber, wireless internet, and CBRS LTE hardware equipment installations will take approximately 30-45 days per tower site. We will be installing (8) towers, with approximate completion in May 2024. Furthermore, the software installation, syncing BN systems, and CPE testing of the network wireless systems will take 15-30 days.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This system will provide fast reliable internet to students that will improve education, decrease the digital divide, and give small businesses the ability to increase their revenues. Moreover, it will also create/enhance housing, education, enabled connectivity through driving apps, urban green space developments, finances, broadband, remote working, and telehealth access opportunities. 
Moreover, regarding the safety of the community, “The Emergency Alert System (EAS), is a national public warning system that requires Radio, and wireline operators to provide the President with the capability to address the American people within 10 minutes during a national emergency.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The funds will be used to provide financial assistance to deploy broadband infrastructure, and internet services in our qualified census tracks in North, South, & West Omaha where insufficient Infrastructure exists. Our internet network will increase educational, business commerce, remote work, and telehealth access tools to leverage community resources. Our fiber, wireless internet, and CBRS LTE technologies launched last Spring will provide customers that qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP); will have access to a $30 dollar subsidies per home discount for internet. This meets the needed development that fits within the cultural context because we can offer free affordable broadband.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our internet infrastructure will address every need in Qualified Census Tracts:
1. We’re located in QCT #11 at 2314 1/2 N 24th St. 68110
2. Our fiber, wireless internet and CBRS LTE technologies broadband services will be in all QCT’s.
3. Student Population (K-12 & College): This group has benefited from today's technologies the most. While many students have access to computers within the school system, research has shown that less than 11% of individuals who live in specific zip codes in North & South Omaha have the means to use Wi-Fi or other technology applications within their home.
4. The Workforce: This group has at its hands more disposable income, without a lot of time on their hands. The use of immediate information is critical and necessary for this group to have hands on work information.
5. Entrepreneurs/Business Owners: Research has shown that the use of technology for any business can improve their sales, brand awareness and ability to do business from anywhere in the world.
6. QCT’s residents who quality for HUD, FCC Lifeline, USF, and Emergency Broadband subsidies will receive a $30 dollar discount on internet services per. household.
7. Increase Economic Development Opportunities.
8. Digital Literacy and Public Access. 
9. Free Affordability Broadband Availability.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 7 Temporary Construction Jobs</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Salary wages starting between 30K-100K per person.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Impacted communities or households are those hindered in their ability to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 due to a lack of broadband (as defined by the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] standard of 25/3 Mbps download/upload speeds), thus impacting the ability to work from home, participate in online learning and/or access to healthcare via Telehealth. So, when we build this internet system, it will provide immediate jobs and ongoing opportunities for businesses, educators, healthcare, contractors, or other workforce members.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Community members living in qualified census tracks in North, South in West Omaha will now have the option of obtaining free to affordable broadband. This access will generate educational, small business growth, economic development, digital literacy, and public access opportunities for Omaha neighborhoods, as well as; Omaha Housing Authority residents and low-income community members who quality for HUD, FCC Lifeline, Universal Service Fund and Emergency Broadband Subsidies, will receive a $30 dollar discount for internet services. Enhanced broadband infrastructure is an important tool for enabling Omaha to address the challenges resulting from this public health crisis.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Broadband access is the equalizer regarding education, business, health, environment, transportation, and the new “Natural Resource”. Once installed those in QCT’s quality of life will immediately improve due to deploy of internet access.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> •	Our new concept CBRS LTE technology broadband services “Tarana Wireless, Inc. is the industry’s performance leader and new category creator in NGFW (next generation fixed wireless access), powered by several well-proven breakthroughs in perfect, multidimensional optimization of radio signals. Our G1 access platform overcomes previously insurmountable network economic challenges for service providers in every market. Tarana’s next G1 releases will take two new directions. First is operation in the 6 GHz unlicensed channels being opened in the US, Canada, and soon other countries around the world. Secondly, is the introduction of G1x2 mode, a software update that doubles the current 80MHz bandwidth of the G1 platform to 160MHz, organized as four independent 40MHz carriers — in either 5 or 6 GHz or both — to deliver up to 1.6 Gbps in aggregate for each G1 link. The Tarana team showed compelling demonstrations of G1x2 mode at its Digital Multiply launch event held today. Operation in G1x2 mode will also be an option available for current shipping of 5 GHz G1 BNs and RNs, with accommodations required for the new rate/reach metrics involved. Also, we will deploy Samsung CBRS LTE network radios and other wireless equipment installations to connect the unconnected.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Our free and paid internet subscriber enrollment levels are the best way to indicate that our system is being used for schools, healthcare facilities, transportation, remote work, or small business usages. These usage tools would indicate if we have increased broadband access and/or usage for those citizens in QCT’s.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Those outcomes will be measured by our paid subscribers, customer satisfaction evaluations, and social media subscribers will; be measured by our sales team.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, the more paid internet subscribers we have as clients, the more residual monthly income we receive every month per household.</p>
