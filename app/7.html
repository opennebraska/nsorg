  <p> Money World trucking is named after Montrell Wiseman  (My younger brother) who passed away to gun violence in late 2012 at the age of 17. To help rebuild Omaha and make the city a better place with his remembrance would be a honor and privilege. My goal is to make a change from our stolen Angels not revenge or a statistic. I would love to use his remembrance to refurbish our home. To show my community there is another way to mourn those who are stolen from us to keep pushing never give up and better is coming. Montrell's nickname was Moneyman I hope to expand one day over the world. This Proposal will re-open doors for my company goals and the message I can give to others with proof that a different way is available and in arms reach as it was for me.
