  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> Our Co-Executive Directors each manage staff within their respective focus. Andrew Norman oversees business management, including development, finance, marketing and project management. Mike Smith oversees program and operations staff, which are split between Omaha and Lincoln. In total, we have 15 full-time staff, and 32 part-time staff.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Our most significant completed project is our Lincoln youth center, The Bay Lincoln (LNK). The Bay LNK is a 20,000-square-foot youth center, featuring Nebraska’s only public indoor skatepark, a digital media lab, and a music venue. Lincoln’s only youth-serving organization open late, The Bay helps young people dream bigger by providing opportunities, exposure, and career pipelines within skateboarding, music, and digital art through our workforce development program and Bay High, a Lincoln Public Schools focus program high school.

Through our Bay High public school at The Bay LNK, we provide 75 junior and senior high school students with future-forward education in: coding/development; design and digital asset creation; digital storytelling and podcasting; and photography and videography. With a student body that comprises 45% racial or ethnic minority students and 51% that qualify for free and reduced lunch, Bay High is Lincoln Public Schools’ second-most-diverse school. Additionally, The Bay LNK is the educational home to 40 18-21-year-old LPS students with special needs through our partnership with LPS’ Independence Academy.

Youth get to our space through various means: their parents/guardians; our vans; partner and school transport; and by bus, board, bike and foot! With a full schedule of uniquely compelling programming — often co-produced with partners — The Bay is where even the hardest-to-reach youth choose to spend their time. Our ability to connect and engage with this demographic has also led to us building strong partnerships with Lancaster County Human Services, who, in addition to financially supporting The Bay LNK, have denoted us as a diversion referral site.

Recently we have been the recipient of the Nebraska Innovator Award (Beyond School Bells, 2022), Stellar Pioneer Award (Star City Pride, 2022), Larry Enersen Urban Design Award (Mayor’s Arts Awards, 2022), Lincoln Community Foundation Kid’s Arts Award (Mayor’s Arts Awards, 2021), Lincoln Small Business of the Year (Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, 2021), and were recognized as a Center of Excellence in Virtual Learning (Beyond School Bells, 2021). Additionally, we are a Best Practices Partner of Nonprofit Association of the Midlands, and have a GuideStar Gold Seal of Transparency.

Concurrent with our strategic plan, we have built our operations and programming for the last five years to scale to Omaha. Our model for The Bay Omaha includes both a career academy, which has received a letter of intent from OPS Superintendent Cheryl Logan, and a formal workforce development program. 

Additionally, we’ve been very successful in engaging program partners and youth throughout North and South Omaha. Just in 2022, we’ve provided 330 programming sessions across 45 clubs to over 750 youth in these communities. Collectively, 87.5% of these kids qualify for free and reduced lunch and/or live in a qualified census tract, and 84.3% identify as a racial or ethnic minority. A number of our partners have informed us that they have never seen their kids as engaged with a provider as they are with Rabble Mill. We’ve been so successful in creating and providing unique and engaging programming for youth in North and South Omaha that we had to make a waiting list for future partnerships.</p>

  <p> 808773.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Rabble Mill requests $808,773 over three years to support the creation and launch of The Bay Omaha (OMA). The Bay OMA is the product of our 24 collective years of nonprofit development and management — including 12 years of operating The Bay LNK. It’s the living manifestation of our mission to help youth statewide achieve belonging, purpose, and upward mobility necessary to grow, achieve, and reinvest in their community. 

Strategically targeting community needs, The Bay OMA’s economic and community development benefits range from juvenile justice diversion and college and career-readiness, to arts infrastructure and tourism. The Bay OMA will provide an accessible place to be; culturally relevant, in-demand experiences; and peer support and mentorship for K-12 youth, during at-risk hours. From digital media and esports to arts and skateboarding, our subject-matter and youth engagement experts help kids dream bigger..  

At The Bay LNK, our college- and career-readiness program creates upward mobility for high school students by preparing them for the jobs of tomorrow — and to be the leaders our communities need. Through after-school clubs targeting Gen Z’s unique interests, 16-24-year-olds develop fundamental, transferable life and career skills, obtain valuable certifications and college credits, and get to truly experience — firsthand from real-world employers — in-demand, future-forward jobs. 

We are bringing these same programs to Omaha. With our own home in the Mastercraft building of the Millwork Commons development, we will be able to host up to 75-100 youth at a time, seven days a week. This space will ensure our ability to program despite inclement weather, is conveniently located for public transportation, and also allows us close proximity to the outdoor Millwork Commons Skate Spot, as well as to other partners. As part of this request, we aim to purchase two passenger vans to help further address any transportation barriers through daily transportation to/from the space. 

We expect our lease to be finalized, and construction to begin, in Q4 of 2022. We plan to begin programming out of this space by spring 2023, with the intention to evolve and grow programs and hours through the following years.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>

  <h3>PercentageCompletedByJuly2025</h3>
  <p> 1.0</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Sustainable Community: Currently, The Bay LNK is home to the only regularly scheduled, public indoor skatepark in Nebraska. The Bay OMA will create a place in Omaha for young people to participate in recreational skateboarding that doesn’t require them traveling to another city. Additionally, The Bay OMA will provide extracurricular educational opportunities, as well as civic uses through partnerships.

Multimodal Transportation: A skateboard is a relatively inexpensive, sustainable transportation vehicle. Through skate clubs, workshops, contests, private lessons, and board and helmet giveaways, we increase transportation opportunities for youth.

Other Infrastructure: We bring unique services and programs — public skatepark, and youth programming — to Millwork Commons’ burgeoning business district. We provide a place to be, something to do and someone who cares for youth in the community.

Quality of Life: The space we will be utilizing for programming in the Mastercraft building is currently an unoccupied 11,000 sq. ft. warehouse that has not yet been renovated for occupancy. As part of our lease agreement, Mastercraft will outfit the space with two single-use ADA restrooms, ceiling fans, AC and heat, seal the roof, and replace the windows, among other improvements. Rabble Mill will be responsible for building out separate spaces for skateboarding (with skate elements), esports, and music, along with a lounge/check-in area, and storage.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Bay OMA addresses a number of prioritized opportunities and threats, as well as community needs, in North Omaha. The space and programming will add to the uniqueness, diversity, and positivity of the area, while also providing an opportunity to add a more nuanced, positive, and productive narrative to the historically crime-focused media coverage of North Omaha. 

There are a number of identified community needs across Uses, Transportation, Infrastructure and Quality of Life that The Bay OMA helps fulfill, including: destination business/events entertainment; develop and open businesses that offer a variety of services while supporting existing businesses; substantial employers with career path opportunities; arts as an awesome driver; more advanced education opportunities for youth, including better technology, courses, and training resources; educational development on the North Omaha community youth; safe places for young adults to “DO” something; invest in future community leaders; and internship opportunities for high school youth.

Through our public events, in tandem with the singularity of our offerings within Omaha, we are a destination for events and entertainment. In the last year, 34% of individuals that visited our Lincoln location came from outside of Lincoln, and 6% came from outside of Nebraska.

In Lincoln, we partner with some of the city’s biggest employers to develop educational pathways, career pipelines, and internships for our youth, including University of Nebraska-Lincoln, ALLO/Nelnet, Crete Carrier (Acklie Charitable Foundation), Lincoln Public Schools, Duncan Aviation, Ameritas, NEBCO (Abel Foundation), and Spreetail. We intend to take this same approach in Omaha while developing our college- and career-readiness program and OPS career academy. We have existing relationships with Mutual of Omaha, Union Pacific, and First National Bank (all of which are in the list of top 10 largest employers in Omaha), along with a number of other businesses and organizations, including Medical Solutions.

These partnerships connect youth with career path opportunities to, and internships with, substantial employers. And youth are uniquely drawn to engage with our programming because it is culturally relevant to them. Our career academy and workforce development program will provide North Omaha youth with access to state-of-the-art technology and equipment, along with specialized education. Being open and available during crucial after-school and weekend hours means youth that often feel out of place in traditional spaces will have a safe place to spend high-risk hours.

Every aspect of Rabble Mill’s programming is intended to help us further our mission of helping Nebraska youth achieve the belonging, purpose, and upward mobility necessary to grow, achieve, and reinvest in their community. We know the youth we serve will be the adults running the city and state in the future, and that when we invest in them, they invest in Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> LB1024 identifies that the North and South Omaha communities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency, and prioritizes grantmaking that supports the economic recovery of these communities, particularly within qualified census tracts. Crime prevention within these tracts is also highlighted as a strategic priority.

The qualified census tracts adjacent to The Bay OMA (tracts 8,12, and 16) are illustrative of the communities in which LB1024 is intended to impact. Tracts 8 and 12 experience higher rates of 18-24-year-olds that haven’t obtained a high school diploma compared to the county, state, and national average. Alarmingly, all three tracts experience significantly higher rates of individuals living below the poverty level — while the national average is 14.1%, and the average for Nebraska is 11.6%%, tracts 8, 12, and 16 experience rates of 26.3%, 32.5%, and 45.1%, respectively.

Additionally, the unemployment rates are markedly higher. The unemployment rate for the 20-64-year-old population in Nebraska is 3.1%. In tracts 8, 12, and 16, however, it is 8.4%, 12.6%, and 7.5%. These differences are only exacerbated when looking at the 16+ population. While the statewide unemployment rate is not drastically different at 3.5%, the rates for tracts 8, 12, and 16 increase to 15.1%, 13.2%, and 8.2%, respectively.

When analyzing this population’s race, these tracts have significantly more Black or African American individuals — tracts 8 and 12 comprise ~55% Black or African American people, compared to the state’s average of 4.9%. This statistic becomes incredibly important when evaluating rates of chronic absenteeism and juvenile crime. In Douglas County, Black youth (along with Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian youth) experience chronic absenteeism at disproportionately higher rates compared to their white counterparts, with these rates only increasing over the past five years. Children of color are also statistically more likely to be charged in adult criminal court, and/or be detained, and Black youth are overrepresented at all system points. The Douglas County Comprehensive Juvenile Service Community Plan identifies Education, Peer Relationships, and Personality/Behavior as being the highest areas of risk/need, which are all areas that The Bay OMA addresses. “What would be most helpful to prevent delinquency would be to make sure [youth] have an opportunity for education, after-school programs, and for cultural advancement,” says Shay Bilchik, who runs the Center for Juvenile Justice Reform at Georgetown University’s Public Policy Institute. The Bay OMA will provide these exact opportunities.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> During the buildout phase, we expect to create around 20 temporary jobs for construction and renovation.

Once buildout is complete, our expected job creation and staffing are as follows:


Fall 2022 - Spring 2023: 166 hours/week, an estimated 7 part-time associate level positions, paying $17/hr ($122,080 total in gross wages and 401k contributions) 

Summer 2023: 395 hours/week, an estimated 13 part-time associate level positions, paying $17/hr ($55,332 total in gross wages and 401k contributions)  

Fall 2023 - Spring 2024: 483 hours/week, an estimated 18 part-time associate level positions, paying $17/hr (355,208 total in gross wages and 401k contributions)

Summer 2024: 565 hours/week, an estimated 17 part-time associate level positions, paying $17/hr ($79,145 total in gross wages and 401k contributions)   

Fall 2024 - Spring 2025: 528 hours/week, an estimated 18 part-time associate level positions, paying $17/hr ($388,302 total in gross wages and 401k contributions) 

Summer 2025: 583 hours/week, an estimated 17 part-time associate level positions, paying $17/hr ($81,667 total in gross wages and 401k contributions)</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> The permanent jobs that The Bay OMA will create will be part-time Program Associate positions, paying $17/hr.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Our Program Associates will have the ability to build partnerships with local businesses and organizations to help inform programming, ensuring the skills that program youth are acquiring fill a need for local employers, and helping to create career pipelines.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Bay OMA is simply a positive addition — a recreational, educational, entertainment destination for youth, parents and other program providers citywide, but especially in North Omaha. Our location puts us within a 15 minute drive from 48 OPS schools (~51% of the entire district), and over the next three years, we expect to serve over 5,000 young people, and expect ~45,000 visits total.

The Bay OMA is operated by Rabble Mill’s talented team of dreamers, creators and hustlers, committed to our organizational core values: Dream Differently; Celebrate Each Other; Honor Relationships; Focus on Solutions, Not Problems; Raise the Tide; and Make it Fun. As a business, The Bay OMA will embody these values for its community, as our staff instill them into our youth.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> More than 38% of current Rabble Mill staff are between the ages of 17-24, including some who came up through our program. We will continue hiring young people, teaching them to reinvest as they gain critical workforce skills. This will help address our neighborhood’s disproportionate rates of unemployment, and add to its economic sustainability.

Through year-round community events, The Bay OMA adds energy, vitality, quality of life. By encouraging physical education and clean transportation, it adds to the community’s sustainability. By giving parents a place to engage their kids during work hours, it adds livability. By serving underserved youth, we add an alternative to the options kids in our community face, decreasing the likelihood a youth enters the juvenile justice system.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> We are largely modeling The Bay OMA off of The Bay LNK. While each city and neighborhood has its own unique needs and interests, The Bay LNK is located in a neighborhood that experiences around triple the poverty rate as compared to the rest of the city, and its residents identify as a racial or ethnic minority at more than double the city average. Between check-ins from the general public, and the youth we serve through after-school programming, Bay High, and our workforce development program, the majority of all program participants reside in a qualified census tract and/or qualify for free and reduced meals, and identify as a racial or ethnic minority. The population we currently serve in Lincoln is essentially parallel to the population we will serve at The Bay OMA.  As a physical space, The Bay LNK is unique not only to Lincoln, but to the country. With an indoor skatepark, content creation space, and digital music area, The Bay OMA will also fill a currently unmet need and desire in the North Omaha community. Our secularity and focus on subculture programming sets us apart from more traditional social service organizations, and while ally organizations such as Omaha Girls Rock, Maha Music Festival, Union for Contemporary Arts, Culxr House and Film Streams use music and/or art to positively affect young people’s lives, we are unique in using skateboarding and the arts to teach valuable digital skills that are translatable across industries.  Our programming and relationship-building strategies (and future space aesthetic) — while non-traditional — incorporate modern research and best practices to specifically reach young people the way they’re most effectively reached. This allows us to cultivate relationships and create significant moments of impact and growth for our community’s hardest-to-reach youth. With numerous awards attributed to The Bay LNK, and a waitlist for programming in Omaha, we feel we have been successful in showing proof of concept.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> We currently measure change in adult and peer relationships, goal setting, confidence, attitude, and desire to learn. For an OPS Career Academy, we will also measure upward mobility of students post-graduation, as well as conventional school assessment metrics like attendance, GPA, and graduation rates.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Our Education Program Manager observes each site and instructor, and also has ongoing conversations with site directors and collaborators, youth participating in clubs, and when available, the parents and guardians.  We administer pre- and post-assessments, with a goal to show an increase in confidence, and improved responses to “I have positive experiences with adults,” “I set goals for myself,” “I feel accepted by my peers,” “I have a positive attitude,” and “I want to learn.” We also ask if participants made any friends through the club, and if they would recommend the club to a friend.  Our 2022 assessment results from Omaha programming are as follows:  - “I have positive experiences with adults.”: “Very Often” and “Always” responses increased from 64% to 74%. - “I set goals for myself.”: “Very Often” and “Always” responses increased from 56% to 66%. - “I feel accepted by my peers.”: “Very Often” and “Always” responses increased from 62% to 74%. - “I have a positive attitude.”: “Very Often” and “Always” responses increased from 67% to 79%. - “I want to learn.”: “Very Often” and “Always” responses increased from 73% to 79%. - On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the most confident, 4 and 5 responses increased from 65% to 69%. - Only 3% of participants said they wouldn’t recommend the club to a friend, and 61% said they made a new friend in the club.  Surveys administered to Omaha site directors at partner organizations also reflect overwhelmingly positive experiences with our programming.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, this Omaha Economic Recovery Act grant would act as a catalyst for securing matching funds from current and prospective supporters. While we have already secured ~54% of our total anticipated expenses for year one, we would leverage this grant to secure increased and multi-year gifts.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> We currently partner with 25 organizations and schools in Omaha to provide after-school programming on-site, including: Belvedere Elementary, Central Park Elementary, Child Saving Institute, Completely KIDS, Conestoga Elementary, Gifford Park Elementary, Girls Inc. North, Girls Inc. South, Gomez Heritage Elementary, inCOMMON Development North, inCOMMON Development South, Jackson Elementary, King Elementary, Latino Center of the Midlands, Lewis and Clark Middle, Liberty Elementary, Lothrop Elementary, Lynch Park, Marrs Middle, Millwork Commons, Nelson Mandela Elementary, Sherman Elementary, and Wakonda Elementary. Once we begin occupying our own programming space at The Bay OMA, we expect many of these partnerships to continue.  For the design of The Bay OMA space, we are partnering with Alley Poyner Macchietto Architecture, who are providing in-kind services to help bring the space to life.  As a diversion referral site, we’ve built strong relationships with the Lancaster County Human Services department through our prevention and promotion programming for the juvenile justice system, and are building similar relationships with the Douglas County Juveniles Services department. Our ability to engage with some of the hardest-to-reach youth in our community allows us to make an impact on the growth and future trajectory of kids who often fall through the cracks.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> We have a letter of support from Omaha Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Cheryl Logan committing to partner on an OPS Career Academy (modeled off of our Lincoln focus program, Bay High), as well as a commitment to bus youth from OPS schools to The Bay OMA.</p>

  <h3>Displacement</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>DisplacementExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> The Bay Omaha location is a currently unoccupied, 11,000 sq. ft. warehouse at 1111 N. 13th St., attached to the north end of the Mastercraft building. The building has numerous qualities conducive to a skatepark, including a concrete floor, 18-foot-high ceiling, and the absence of obstructions such as pillars, decreasing construction costs. It is located in Census Tract 5, where the percentage of adults without a high school diploma is ~7% higher than the state average, the poverty rate is over 9% higher than the state average, and unemployment rates are around double the state average.

The Mastercraft building features tenant companies that currently are, or have the potential to be, partner organizations, including Prairie Stem, Webberized Podcast Production, Women’s Fund of Omaha, Field Day Development, Mentor Nebraska, Flatwater Free Press, Nonprofit Association of the Midlands, Metropolitan Community College Community and Workforce Education, Torchwerks, and more.</p>

Our Operations Director, Aaron Markley, has been managing a $600,000 building renovation at The Bay LNK since January 2022. He used an analogous estimation process to determine future expenses for this project based on actual labor, materials, and procurement expenses from The Bay LNK project. Estimates also take into account potential price increases due to inflation, and market variables like supply, demand, and shipping congestion.</p>

  <p> No</p>

  <h3>GeneralContractorPublicCompetitiveBid</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>GeneralContractorPublicCompetitiveBidWhyNot</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> Our initial lease (included with this application) was priced at $14/sq. ft. in Year 1, $14.50/sq. ft. in Year 2, and $15/sq. ft. in Year 3. We have countered this offer, and our request reflects an aim to negotiate our rent to $11/sq. ft. in Year 1, $11.50/sq. ft. in Year 2, and $12/sq. ft. in Year 3. 

Cleaning supplies and tech expenses have been determined based on current prices from Uline and Target. 

We have budgeted Program Associate wages at $17/hr, plus an additional 3% for 401(k) matching, along with payroll taxes, our payroll system cost per employee ($12/monthly), and providing Nonprofit Association of the Midlands Employee Assistance Program benefits to each employee ($48.37/year/employee). The majority of our Program Associates are younger staff, often having been through our programming, and we know the importance of compensating these positions and individuals at a rate that is more reflective of actual living costs, as well as helping set them up for success by investing in their retirement savings.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Funding from an LB1024 grant would support capital, tech, and facility expenses in Year 1, and facility and program expenses in Years 2 and 3. 

Capital expenses include the initial buildout of the warehouse, along with purchasing furniture to outfit the space, and purchasing two passenger vans to transport youth to and from the space daily. Tech expenses include multimedia programming equipment (projectors, iPads, etc.). Facility expenses include rent and recurring expenses like cleaning supplies. Program expenses are primarily wages for Program Associates.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> Despite not previously having a physical location in Omaha, a number of our largest, and most consistent, funders are Omaha-based, and have increased their giving year-over-year as our Omaha programming has grown. We have kept these partners engaged throughout the process of ideating and planning The Bay OMA, and are confident they will continue supporting the organization long-term, as well as adjust their giving to reflect our increased presence and impact in Omaha. We also expect to identify and secure new sources of contributed income once we have a dedicated facility in Omaha.   Since 2017, our development team has consisted on one staff member (with contributions from other teams and our Co-EDs) — earlier this year, we hired a development coordinator, which is allowing us to maintain our existing relationships while also giving our development director the capacity to explore federal funding opportunities, connect with more business donors, and spend more time collaborating with our Co-EDs on annual giving strategies.  At this point in the year, we are at ~95% of our total fundraising goal for the fiscal year (January - December). We have secured funding from six new funders, and have pending asks out to an additional eight potential first-time funders. We have also been increasingly securing multi-year funding, we are constantly connecting with new potential donors, and in nearly every meeting, ask our contact if there’s other individuals or organizations that we should be meeting with and/or that would be interested in our work (for both funding and programming partnership opportunities).</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> Because we have/are approaching a number of different potential funders, we are not reliant on one single supporter to ensure the success of The Bay OMA proposal.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> The Bay OMA cannot be completed in smaller components. We have been intentional about building The Bay LNK to be scalable to other communities, including Omaha, but because the entirety of The Bay OMA is being built out of one existing space, we are unable to complete construction and renovation in separate components without disrupting programming. Because the scale of the buildout is also not extensive, we expect to be able to finalize the lease, renovate the space for our needs, and begin programming in less than six months total.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> proposal.
Nearly $500,000 of our secured funding for year one of our proposal comes from general operating grants. While we could allocate these funds to any expenses in our organizational budget of ~$2M (exclusive of The Bay OMA expenses), we are committed to ensuring the success of The Bay OMA. Additionally, we are committing staffing, fundraising efforts, and relationships to support this proposal.</p>
