  <p> LEDC: “OMAHA — Today it’s a South Omaha parking lot, mostly, with a few benches and trees and a plaque dedicated in 1988: “La Plaza de la Raza, The Gathering Place of the Races.” But local advocates say the 24th and N Streets pocket is rundown and never got the polishing it was supposed to in a past revamp of the historic South 24th Street. Now a combined $1 million from Douglas County and the City of Omaha pushes the plaza closer to a $3 million transformation into a corridor centerpiece and state tourism draw.”

Canopy South: Founded in 2019, Canopy South was created with one purpose - to generate holistic and effective revitalization in South Omaha neighborhoods through strategic partnerships and community-driven initiatives. Canopy South prioritizes choice by dismantling systemic barriers to reinforce equitable access to opportunity for all.

Canopy South, a nonprofit organization, is one of 28 members following a national model established by Purpose Built Communities, a nonprofit organization founded by Tom Cousins, Warren Buffett, and Julian Robertson that focuses on four fundamental focus areas (1) developing mixed income housing, (2) establishing a cradle-to-career education pipeline, (3) enhancing community vibrancy, and (4) elevating economic vitality. By being a member of the national network, the organization has access to a multi-disciplinary team with the combination of expertise, experience, and partnerships to support holistic, long-term, sustainable neighborhood revitalization efforts.

At Canopy South, we believe that by changing the environment, we can change outcomes for people who live there. We are breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty with a coordinated and holistic revitalization of the neighborhood.
Canopy South just celebrated our third birthday and we have spent these initial years building a strong foundation, creating a culture of excellence, and cultivating trust with partners and residents. Our first major accomplishment as an organization was receiving a $1.3M Choice Neighborhoods Planning + Action grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in partnership with the City of Omaha and Omaha Housing Authority to create a holistic Transformation Plan for the Southside Terrace – Indian Hill neighborhood. Through extensive resident and stakeholder engagement the Transformation Plan was accepted by HUD. 

In Summer 2021, Canopy South was awarded $1.65M in private and public funding to establish a revolving loan fund to develop or rehabilitate owner-occupied single-family homes in Qualified Census Tracts. This was a collaborative grant application with several other nonprofit organizations totaling $13.6M. 

In September 2022, the City of Omaha, Omaha Housing Authority and Canopy South were one of four cities across the U.S. who were awarded a Choice Neighborhood Implementation grant from HUD. This allocation of $50M will support the holistic revitalization of the Southside Terrace – Indian Hill neighborhood.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> A strategic concept for the South 24th Street addresses six fundamental opportunities, building on the district’s demonstrated strengths:

Realization of the Plaza de la Raza concept of an accessible, inclusive place for performance, play, and public life/tourism – a zocalo that belongs to and is comfortable for Omahans.

Creation of a Latino Cultural and Economic Development Center, a unique facility that will provide programs and spaces that incubate and support businesses based in arts, culture, and economic development..  

Addressing parking and transportation issues and opportunities. Activity increases parking demand and during peak weekend hours, the diagonal parking along the street is already fully utilized.  The Plaza development will have an impact on overall parking supply. A conveniently located, multi-purpose parking ramp can both address existing problems and help create the conditions for new types of economic development, geared to hospitality and tourism. In addition, transportation solutions will also include transit and alternative modes like bicycling that provide alternatives to the car. 

Affordable Mix-income housing. Downtown and Midtown Omaha have demonstrated the importance and marketability of residential development in business districts, and new housing construction has spread to neighborhood districts like Benson, Ralston, and even South Omaha itself. A properly structured housing development can add to our inventory of badly needed affordable housing, as well as increasing the customer base for local businesses. 

Continuation of the core business district outward to adjacent streets, including the 24th Street corridor to the north and 25th Street to the west.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The actual design of the Plaza will be a community-wide project, inviting the participation of a wide range of people with connections to and love for South Omaha. The preliminary concept discussed here responds to initial comments from the planning group and is designed to start the conversation and generate a planning level estimate of costs. Principles and features of the concept include:

Performance facility. A top priority for the Plaza will be creating a space for music, dance, and other performing arts that is accessible to a wide range of performers, from kids to professionals. The site’s topography can create a natural amphitheater with a performance stage that responds to available resources. Attractions & activities will drive foot traffic to South Omaha that will create economic tourism to the district.

Consistency with the existing streetscape. South Omaha is everybody’s territory. The 24th Street streetscape reflects the symbols and folk art of the people and cultures that have called South Omaha home, while emphasizing the materials, spirit, and colors of public spaces and streets of Mexico and other Latin American countries. The Plaza design will be similarly inclusive, emphasizing Latino culture while also reflecting the neighborhood’s historic and contemporary diversity.

Play. Public spaces in commercial districts benefit from having places for kids that invite play and interaction with other kids and the environment. But the project envisions fun with meaning, potentially including features that encourage children to make and experiment with music and sound and to explore other parts of the environment. To that end, we are partnering with UNO as part of the university’s Urban Thinkspace initiative.

Gathering space. The busy 24th Street district should be complemented by separate areas where people can gather in small groups or be by themselves to read, think, or watch the life of the street.

Accessibility. The grade of the site west of 24th Street is deceptively steep and approaches 10%. The concept ensures accessibility to people with limited mobility while using the grade to provide stepped terraces as seating for enjoying performances or simply the view and life of the district.

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> In the last few years, cultural tourism has become a key tool that cities have to attract visitors and pursue additional revenues. According to the United Nations’ World Tourism Organization, Cultural Tourism implies “A type of tourism activity in which the visitor’s essential motivation is to learn, discover, experience and consume the tangible and intangible cultural attractions/products in a tourism destination. These attractions/products relate to a set of distinctive material, intellectual, spiritual and emotional features of a society that encompasses arts and architecture, historical and cultural heritage, culinary heritage, literature, music, creative industries and the living cultures with their lifestyles, value systems, beliefs and traditions” (Tourism and Culture | UNWTO). The increasing importance of cultural tourism has also been fueled by a series of conventions at the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which has advocated for a more inclusive approach to history and culture that includes everyday activities, the preservation of both the distant past and of living and threatened cultures, and the inclusion of intangible cultural heritage, and not only tangible monuments and historical areas (Loukaitou-Sideris, A., & Soureli, K. (2012). Cultural Tourism as an Economic Development Strategy for Ethnic Neighborhoods. Economic Development Quarterly, 26(1), 50–72).
While cultural tourism should not be considered the only tool for revitalization and economic development of an area, it does bring with it significant revenues. The economic impact of cultural tourism in the US can be measured in the hundreds of billions and increasingly a substantial number of people choose a destination for personal identity, heritage, and cultural reasons. According to the Goss Agency, increasing visitors associated to cultural tourism means not only more money to the general economy, but also helps diversify the local economy supports and helps expand small business, spreads economic benefits to groups usually excluded, helps build and strength community relations, and encourages the maintenance of new and existing amenities (https://thegossagency.com/2016/03/03/the-real-impact-of-a-cultural-tourism-strategy/).
The Adelante project offers among other things, the possibility of strengthening South Omaha as a cultural tourist destination, unlike any other in the Midwest. Building on top of the success of the Cinco de Mayo Festival and the nearby El Museo Latino, this project will consolidate a South Omaha as a unique place in the Midwest; the only one between Chicago on the East, at least Denver on the West, and Kansas City on the South.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The South Omaha community and business district suffered during and after the Covid pandemic so this Adelante II proposal will be one of the most transformational projects to create and have an economic impact for generations to come.From the newly created business center, mixed income housing, plaza de la raza green space, parking structure will come 25-40 full-time and part-time jobs created to operate these in South Omaha. What is more exciting what comes from the programming that assist new business to be created that will take South Omaha to a new level of workforce development and entrepreneurship that will bring millions of dollars in new revenue to the community along w/ millions of tourism to the South Omaha business district in 68107, 68108 and 68105. Please see the Operations and Programming document within the attachment for more information.</p>

A properly structured housing development can add to our inventory of badly needed affordable housing, as well as increasing the customer base for local businesses.  A mixed-income approach to housing is essential so that people at all stages of life  have affordable options. Distressed neighborhoods have very high transiency rates, 2-3 times than that of healthy neighborhoods, which means that the entire neighborhood is “self-displacing” every three or four years on average. Half of low-income transiency is due to people “fleeing” these last-resort neighborhoods.   Continuation of the core business district outward to adjacent streets, including the 24th Street corridor to the north and 25th Street to the west. The plan sets forth a mission to create conditions for economic growth and improved quality of life for Latinos in Omaha. It addresses the need to focus on Youth and Adults in South Omaha, the need to focus on Workforce Development and Latino Leadership Development, and the need to celebrate the Culture of Latinos.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Nebraska has been considered a “new immigrant destination” since the early 2000s. Most of this growth has been fueled by newcomers from Latin America. In the last 20 years, while the population of Nebraska has grown at an average of 0.7% annually, foreign-born population has grown at an average of 3.7% and Latin Americans at 4.3%. In this same period, on average, half of foreign-born population residing in the State was born in Latin America. This growth on Latinos is not only due to immigration. Most importantly, there is a fast growing second generation of US born Latinos who will have an important effect in the demographic future of the state. mai
Omaha is a highly segregated city with more than half of all Latinos in Omaha residing in South Omaha. Latinos in South Omaha are most likely to live in poverty. Two-thirds of Latino in South Omaha have incomes at or lower that 125% of the poverty level. In the case of non-Latinos, this percentage is only 33%. As in other parts of Nebraska, Latinos work mostly in construction and the meatpacking industry. As it is well-know, the COVID-19 pandemic has had disastrous effects on the Latino population in the United States. Nebraska has not been an exception. According to the latest available data, the impact of COVID-19 in Nebraska and in Omaha has been dramatic. Latinos has suffered close to 60% of cases and 1 of every 4 of the deaths; throughout the pandemic the daily number of cases among Latinos doubled and sometimes even tripled the number of cases for non-Latinos.
While there is no definitive data yet on the social and economic impact of COVID-19 in South Omaha, recent analysis done by UNO’s Office of Latino/Latin American Studies (OLLAS) shows that these have been significant. In a series of interviews with community leaders between 2020 and 2022, OLLAS has found that COVID-19 significantly increased vulnerability levels of the South Omaha community. Not only with regards to health vulnerability (including mental health vulnerability), but the pandemic also uncovered and heightened existing food insecurity, lack of access to technology, educational support, and lack of protection to women from domestic violence. At the same time, OLLAS research also found a significant negative impact to Latino-owned business, especially those owned by women.
While community organizations played an important role in assisting those in need within the South Omaha community, these organizations were also overstretched and, in some cases, lacked the necessary resources and expertise to provide the required help, especially considering that the socio-economic crisis resulting from COVID-19 impacted every single aspect of life. Now that main origin of this crisis has subsumed, and some sources of aid have decreased, there is a growing need to develop a social and economic recovery plan for South Omaha, which will not only address the post COVID-19 context, but which will include community and economic development as well as programs that can prepare South Omaha for future crisis and create a more vibrant and prosperous community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Sustainable practices will be incorporated into the design of the plaza, streetscape, buildings, and parking garage.  Some of the sustainable practices include improving impervious coverage for stormwater management by adding greenspace to areas that were once concrete or asphalt. LED lighting will be incorporated into the design of the plaza, streetscape, buildings and parking garage. Local materials will be used where possible.  LEED and WELL building certification guidelines will be followed in the design of the buildings and parking garage.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> As noted above the design of the facilities will follow LEED and WELL building certification guidelines. One of Omaha’s first urban thinkscapes will be incorporated into the design of the plaza in partnership with UNO.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsMOU</h3>
  <p> Executing this project will require a partnership of community organizations, development corporations, businesses, and citizens of South Omaha. An initial concept for this partnership includes:  The LEDC (Latino Economic Development Corporation). LEDC will lead fundraising, marketing, community engagement, and project oversight.  Canopy South will be the fiscal agent and administrator of grant funds through ARPA. UNO OLLAS- A satellite UNO OLLAS Research Center, will serve as a hub for the intangible cultural heritage of the immigrant and Latino communities that have enriched South Omaha since the late 1800s. This space will coalesce the multiple archives, currently on private hands, of the immigrant and Latino experience. Will be able to gather these collections to provide them with a home where they will be accessible to the community and to researchers from all over the country. We will rely on the current contacts that OLLAS has with the Smithsonian Latino Center to seek an institutional agreement between both institutions. The physical area where this center will be located will include classrooms, exhibition areas, and research areas. The inclusion of a UNO OLLAS office within this building will also make it possible to bring UNO classes to South Omaha and increase recruitment and retention of high school and college Latino students. This is of crucial importance to the development of a highly educated labor force among the growing Latino population, which are currently more than 16% of Omaha’s population and will reach more than 30% by 2050.</p>
