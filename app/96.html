  <p> Established in 2006, Sheltering Tree is a burgeoning 501(c)(3) organization tackling an urgent issue; the growing housing crisis for adults with developmental disabilities (DD).  Sheltering Tree builds and operates affordable apartment communities for adults with DD, launching them toward maximum independence, productive and fulfilling lives, and the opportunity to belong and contribute to the greater community in which they live.

Holding our organizational values of safety, affordability, community, and self-determination at the forefront of all we do, Sheltering Tree has been successfully planning, building, and operating affordable apartment communities for sixteen years.  With locations in the Bellevue and Benson areas, thirty-two affordable apartment units are occupied by adults with DD.  Currently, under construction, a $13.2 million apartment community of two twenty-four-unit apartment buildings in Papillion will be ready for occupancy in June 2023. With future tenants already identified and ready to move into the Shadow Lake location, once occupied, Sheltering Tree will maintain seventy-six affordable apartments. A duplicate of the Papillion project, forty-eight units are slated to be built in Elkhorn in Q3 2023. Sheltering Tree maintains a list of over 200 individuals with DD waiting for an apartment.

The McNally family of Omaha began the journey for Sheltering Tree for their son who has Down syndrome.  The McNallys brought expertise in real estate law and background with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This expertise has been critical to the development of affordable apartment living for adults with DD.  The McNally Family remains active in the organization to this date. Additionally, Sheltering Tree Board Members come from a variety of backgrounds with several who have experience working with Affordable Housing Developments.  

Sheltering Tree’s programming includes a robust Activity and Enrichment program that offers life-enhancing experiences for tenants. This program is designed to combat the isolation adults with DD face and enrich their lives through activities and experiences. Through the activity and enrichment programming, adults with DD are provided access to arts, culture, and humanities as well as entertainment and sporting events. Our consumer-controlled housing model allows for the tenants to be self-determined and follow their particular areas of interest such as ballroom dancing, horticulture, literature, photography, music, ceramics, painting, and a variety of cultural activities. Area artists and volunteers provide instruction and exposure to a variety of enriching activities. Monthly calendars typically include eight physical fitness activities, four creative/art activities, one seasonal community event, one cooking activity, four social gatherings, occasional sporting or cultural events, and four book club meetings.

Sheltering Tree also offers the GOALS-Greater Opportunity for Apartment Living Success program to both current and future tenants.  GOALS offers classes to prepare future and current tenants to live safe, healthy, enriched lives and achieve long-term success living in their own apartments.  Six key topics will be taught in fun, interactive classes. Topics include: 1) Nebraska Rent Wise-How to Be a Successful Tenant, 2) Money Management-Real World Budgeting, 3) Personal Health and Wellness, 4) First Aid/CPR, 5) Be Safe-Properly Interacting with First Responders, 6) People Skills-Social Success. GOALS offers Parent/Guardian workshops to equip parents/guardian them with the resources they may need to help their family members with DD in succeeding in independent apartment living.  

Sheltering Tree maintains a good working relationship with partners: Midwest Housing Equity Group, Nebraska Investment Finance Authority (NIFA), Project Advocates, Burlington Capitol, Seldin Company, Nebraska Housing Developers Ass., Dept. of Economic Development, FHLB Topeka, HUD.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Sheltering Tree currently has a waiting list of 200+ prospective tenants and a population of more than 25,000 adults with DD living in Nebraska. Sheltering Tree provides consumer-controlled apartment living, which includes 24/7 Tenant Assistant monitored safety and security. Each tenant has their own rent-subsidized apartment that includes a living room, full kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and storage closets.  Apartments are built with durable materials, a sensory-friendly design, easy-to-clean features, equipped with bathroom safety bars, access to mobility support, and can be modified for those with low vision or for those with hearing loss. The property and apartments were universally designed with the intention of offering the tenant with DD the security of aging-in-place. Sheltering Tree Community Apartments offer amenities that are beneficial to adults with DD. Amenities such as; Controlled Access Entry, Live-Work-Play Community Rooms, On-Site Laundry, Activity Director/Community Life Activity Calendar, Meal Plan, Accessible Design, Pedestrian Oriented Locations, Security Cameras, Health and Wellness Space/Activities, Life Skills Training Program, Therapeutic Garden, and Tenant Assistants living on-site.

Our proposed project in South Omaha would consist of one building containing a total of twenty-four units total; twenty-two one-bedroom units, approximately 665 square feet of affordable housing for adults with DD, and two manager units. The tenants will have access to a commons area consisting of an entrance lobby, gathering room, dining room, community kitchen, storm shelter, mechanical room, laundry room, and wellness center. There will also be a paved and lighted parking lot with a drive-up area located under an entrance canopy. 

It is highly important that the project is located near a “town center” where access to grocery stores, employment opportunities, and entertainment are within walking distance.  This is a critical consideration as most of the adults we serve are not able to drive.  Discussions are underway to identify land for the building.

Once land is identified and funding becomes available, the project can be completed in eighteen months.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> The project would begin immediately upon funding availability in July 2023 and be completed in March 2025

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Sheltering Tree, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization tackling an urgent issue; the growing housing crisis for adults with developmental disabilities (DD).  Sheltering Tree builds affordable apartment communities for persons with DD.  The purpose of housing initiated by Sheltering Tree, Inc. is to create affordable, consumer-controlled, quality, apartment-style communities to help adults with DD achieve maximum independence, lead productive and fulfilling lives, build friendships, belong to, and contribute to the greater community in which they live.

The need for consumer-controlled, community-centered apartment living for adults with DD is vast. The Residential Information Systems Project (2020) conducted by the University of Minnesota, RISP, Research and Training Center on Community Living, Institute on Community Integration tells us: There are 7.37 million People with I/DD in the United States. 6.14 million do not receive public funds for residential support- 83%. Of the 1.2 million that receive public funds for residential support totaling 17%, 715,000 or 10% receive support in the family home, 368,000 or 5% in a provider-controlled setting, and 147,000 or 2% in a consumer-controlled setting.

The Nebraska DHHS Residential Services Waiting List now indexes over 2,500 individuals with DD. Most wait for an average of seven years before residential services are available. Sheltering Tree currently has a waiting list of 200+ prospective tenants.  With a population of more than 25,000 adults with DD living in Nebraska, the waiting list for affordable, accessible, consumer-controlled apartments will only grow as hundreds exit the special education school system each year and begin seeking adult-related support and solutions for basic needs.  The Sheltering Tree organization is rapidly growing as we work towards filling this need gap.

Although some live with their parents, many adults with DD will outlive their caregivers leaving them with significant housing insecurities. The State of the States in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 11th ed. Washington, D.C.: American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2017 report states; 1.3 million people with I/DD lived with a caregiver over the age of sixty. 

Because we know that disability does not discriminate, it exists in all communities regardless of socio-economic status, race, or culture.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Although many issues summarized following the Visioning Workshop do impact individuals with DD, there seems to be no acknowledgment or knowledge of the need for secure, safe, affordable housing or the related needs to support adults with DD.  It is not uncommon for this population to be unnoticed by their wider community.  Often most are not aware of the adult with DD’s unique needs.  This often results in their needs and supports being unlikely to be addressed, leaving them again as invisible people in society. 
Although an adult with DD has similar needs as the aging seniors in the community, they are not the same.  Sheltering Tree provides a solution to many of the foundational needs an adult with DD needs within a community.   Issues that are general to the wider community that also impact adults with DD are typically related to affordable housing, public transportation, belonging and connectivity to the community, walkability to basic needs like groceries, health care, and a safe environment for the vulnerable.
Sheltering Tree will offer employment opportunities to the surrounding community. The Sheltering Tree South Apartments will employ two live-in Tenant Assistants that benefit from their compensation package including free rent and utilities as well as a salary.  Additional part-time staff will be employed in various areas as well. Additional part-time staff will be employed in various areas as well. Typically, 90% of tenants living at Sheltering Tree will use DHHS Waiver funding to hire support professionals to assist them with activities of daily living offering the prospect of approximately nineteen other employment opportunities.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Sheltering Tree South Apartments will not only put a dent in the safe, affordable, accessible housing crisis that is facing adults with DD, but it will also provide an aesthetically beautiful and well-maintained building to the area.  It will offer various employment opportunities to the community. The development will allow for adults with DD to remain in the area where they are familiar, alongside their churches, family members, and familiar services.  People with disabilities add to a diverse community. They teach us compassion, acceptance, and humility. They often enjoy working entry-level hard-to-fill jobs that many in the community reject.  They show us, in a profound way, what it means to be whole.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> The Sheltering Tree South Apartments will employ two live-in Tenant Assistants that benefit from a compensation package that includes rent and utilities valued at $12K annually as well as a salary of $20K-$25K equaling $32-$37K annually.   Part-time employees are paid $14-15 per hour.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> As a source of affordable housing for adults with DD, Sheltering Tree, Inc. follows all Fair Housing laws and will not refuse to rent a dwelling to any person because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, familial status, sexual orientation, or national origin. Our current tenants as well as our future tenants on our waiting list of over 200 individuals represent a variety of ethnic, racial, religious, age, and gender demographics. 

We know that people with DD live in all communities and cultures. After taking a hard look at our outreach efforts, with the intention of getting better at sharing our unique type of housing with underserved members of our community, we have included in our strategic planning to be more intentional about diversifying our outreach and this is now part of our practical vision.  

The Sheltering Tree organization strives to offer consumer-controlled, affordable, safe, community-centered apartment living in all areas of our city. Our work is laser-focused working to fill the gap in the urgent need for housing and community for adults with DD.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Sheltering Tree’s Activity and Enrichment program greatly improve the quality of life of the tenants. Chronic loneliness is known to be as significant of a health issue as obesity, diabetes, and long-term smoking. For people with DD, loneliness and social isolation is a prevailing infliction. This program provides an enriching environment, full of ways to connect and stay active. 
Historically, results of the Activity and Enrichment program include successfully providing adults with DD access to the wider metro community, creating opportunities for meaningful, enriching, hands-on activities, and creating an opportunity to practice navigating the wider community with trusted support persons other than their parents/guardians. Looking to always facilitate long-term success for our tenants, the program offers activities for adults with DD to live dignified, meaningful lives, and acquire a sense of belonging. 
During monthly tenant meetings, feedback is provided about current activities, and input is given about future activities. We utilize a communication tool called Life Loop. This communication tool allows families to see what events the tenants participate in, it allows the tenants to give feedback on their satisfaction with the activities, and it allows for easy signing up for activities. Additionally, a tenant serves as a self-advocate on our Board of Directors to be sure that lived experience is considered in all decision-making.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> Housing options for people with DD have changed dramatically over the past century. This change has been marked by a more individualized and integrated housing situations that offer choice and community inclusion. There are many types of living arrangements for people with DD, and the differing names and categories can seem a little confusing, especially if you are navigating the housing market for the first time. That’s why we put together this quick list of the most forward-thinking housing options for people with disabilities.   The Sheltering Tree model allows adults with DD to live as independently as possible by utilizing subsided rents and providing amenities advantageous to their wellbeing.  With this model it is up to the person to determine what ongoing support they need, making it a truly person-centered approach.   Sheltering Tree is one a few organizations across the country offering consumer-controlled, safe, affordable, community-centered living for adults with DD.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Quality of life is a social construct that is measured by what are its most appropriate indicators. Quality of life measurement in developmental disability reflects a variety of indicators, often grouped under life domains.  In the past, Sheltering Tree has partnered with Dr. Michelle Messer and Creighton University students to conduct a qualitative survey to measure tenant quality of life.  Extremely positive results were found in areas of social environment, emotional health, physical environment, and independence. We continue to seek partnerships such as this to measure the outcome results of consumer-controlled housing for adults with DD.</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> Connections with Creighton University Medical Students, Creighton University Occupational Therapy Students, Clarkson Nursing Students, College of St. Mary Occupational Therapy Students, UNO Service-Learning Students, as well as retired Servants of Mary Sisters, have provided volunteer and peer support for on-site activities.  Sheltering Tree has acted as a site mentor and provided practical and capstone experiences for graduate students pursuing doctoral degrees in Occupational Therapy at both Creighton University and the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  Our partnership with Why Arts provides artists such as: Visual Artists, Florists, Musicians, Dance Instructors, and Ceramic Artists to mention a few.   Various community volunteers share their particular talents with tenants as well, such as yoga instruction, fitness, handcrafts, and fine arts.     Area garden clubs provide opportunities for tenants to garden alongside them on the Sheltering Tree property and enjoy various types of gardening.   Continuing to foster community while social distancing during the pandemic added an extra layer of difficulty to our efforts. An unintended outcome of the need to social distance that we discovered was that there were tenants with DD that prefer to join from a distance and were more likely to participate with the Zoom option. We continue utilizing Zoom to differentiate ways for our tenants to connect and belong, for example during the weekly Graphic Novel club where tenants from a variety of locations gather in person and via Zoom to explore and engage in literature and the enjoyment of a good story.</p>
