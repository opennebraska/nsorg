  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The purpose of the IAA is to break down existing economic and physical barriers of access to youth sports programming at all levels and sports facilities to build bridges across the Omaha metropolitan area, with a strong focus on ensuring that traditionally underserved communities have the access, support and training which such communities have historically lacked.  The goal of the IAA is to develop innovative programming that fosters equality, equity, access and exposure for a broad and diverse group of young athletes and their families.  The IAA through a unique holistic player pathway in cooperation with its current partners will support young athletes and their families with sports physicals, mental health services, tutoring, college recruiting assistance , sports performance, nutrition education, and much more.   

Phase 1 of the Ames St. Youth Sports Project will consist of Indoor MultiSport Fieldhouse with Sports Performance.  Phase 1b will consist of 4 lighted field turf multi sports fields.  Phase II will consist of one hard court building of 8 volleyball/8 basketball courts.

The targeted area for this project is 30th St to 52nd, between Sprague St. and Ames St.  The first phase to be completed by Fall of 2024.</p>
