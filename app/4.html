  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> I am mostly a one person operation. I plan and design weddings. Then set them up, coordinate the event and then tear down and clean up. I started in 2019 with 4 single service bookings and worked my way up to 2022 with 17 partial or full service bookings. I would love to be able to hire at least one or two helpers and expand my inventory. I would also love to get my LLC paperwork finished.</p>

  <p> Many people get married, but they're not many vendors that work with all budgets. I would like to be the go to wedding planner that works with every budget and can accommodate a special event for every person who wants to get married.</p>
