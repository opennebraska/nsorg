  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> The Nebraska State Legislature outlines the procedure for creating a BID in Statutes 19-4015 to 19-4038, otherwise known as the Business Improvement District Act. This state statute gives the BID the legal jurisdiction to plan, fund and facilitate infrastructure projects including: litter control, building façade improvements, enhanced streetscapes, area security, lighting, and marketing. On June 2, 2020, the Omaha City Council approved an ordinance establishing the North 24th Street Business Improvement District (BID No. 6878) by a vote of 6 to 0. The North 24th Street Business Improvement District is established “for the purpose of providing specified activities, work and improvements in the North 24th Street area (Meredith Avenue to the north, 25th Avenue to the west, Cuming Street to the south, and 23rd Street to 20th Street to the east) of Omaha, Nebraska.” In addition to the North 24th Street Business Improvement District, the North 24th Street Business Improvement District Association, a corresponding 501(c)(3) that serves as a philanthropic fiscal agent and provides operational support for the BID. The Executive Committee of the Association is as follows: Dr. Ralph Lassiter, Board President; Todd Defreece, Vice President; Ralph Kleinsmith, Secretary, and Bentley Swan, Treasurer. LaVonya Goodwin is the Executive Director of the Association and reports to the Executive Committee. The BID has several committees that incorporate a diversified group of stakeholders with expertise for specialized projects. See attached organizational chart.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The North 24th Street Infrastructure Improvement Plan is transformational for North 24th Street in function and appearance because it focuses on renovating, repairing, and revitalizing the physical and build environment. This proposal requests funding for façade improvement, streetscape upgrade, broadband implementation and technical assistance for businesses within the North 24th Street Streetscape area. Phase I of the Façade Improvement Program will begin in October of 2023 to preserve 5 to 10 iconic buildings on the front footage of North 24th Street. Technical project assistance will be provided to applicants of the Façade Improvement Program. The North 24th Street Master Streetscape Plan is a plan implemented in phases and organized by zones. Zone 1 is from Patrick Ave. to Cuming St; Zone 2 is from Ohio St. to Patrick Ave; Zone 3 is from Ohio St. to Spencer St.; Zone 4 is form Spencer St. to Meredith Ave. The Streetscape Master Plan will address: sidewalk and curb repair, traffic speed control, signaling infrastructure, pedestrian safety, lighting, sustainable landscaping, historical theming, parking, and multimodal transit. A $3.6M earmark has been secured to begin Phase I and will focus on Zone 2 from Ohio Street to Lizzie Robinson. See the attached project timeline which shows a completed streetscape plan by July of 2026. 
 North 24th Street Broadband Implementation is designed to provide a fiber-optic upgrade of 1 gigabyte to an underserved area. The broadband implementation will provide increased upload and download speeds to users at an affordable rate. The timeline for broadband implementation would follow the streetscape construction timeline closely.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Located in the heart of Omaha's African American community, the North 24th Street Business Improvement District advocates for social justice and economic equality by implementing strategies that seek to undo the effects of redlining; infrastructural loss; depopulation and disinvestment. It is with this historic purview that the stakeholders of North 24th Street formed the North 24th Street Business Improvement District (BID) as a critical component to the revitalization of one of Omaha’s main arteries. The outcomes of the BID Infrastructure Improvement Plan are in alignment with the Forever North Strategy https://planninghcd.cityofomaha.org/forevernorth.
The BID seeks funding to provide a Façade Improvement Program to assist building owners in renovating and sustaining the existing building stock within the BID area. There are 37 buildings that contribute to the 24th and Lake Historic District on the National Historic Register. Qualifying projects (project do not have to be historically designated to apply) will utilize funding to restore and replace exterior elements including: doors, windows, lighting, security, masonry and roofing and must show the ability to successfully complete work in a timely manner. This application is a request for funding to cover project costs, provide gap financing and technical assistance for building owners in the area. Program guidelines will follow similar requirements as the Community Block Development Grant application.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> “30% of corridor workers walk, bicycle, carpool, or use transit to get to work; only 13% of City workers overall use the same means. » 21.7% of occupied housing units in the corridor have no car compared to 8.2% in the City.” (Forever North Housing and Multimodal Strategy). Transportation: The North 24th Street Streetscape Master Plan, https://confluence.mysocialpinpoint.com/north24, outlines the need for improved walkability, slower traffic speeds, bus shelters and transit amenities. It is also a supporting document for MetroNext, https://www.ometro.com/metronext/a transit plan to improve connectivity and transit access in Omaha. This plan calls for the implementation of transit amenities for the North 24th Street transit route, including 14 bus shelters and 38, 3-seat benches across the 2.3-mile corridor (which currently has the highest ridership in Omaha, but no bus shelters). This plan also calls for better connectivity of transit with the Greater Omaha area to connect households to jobs and other services and amenities. There are 4 phases to the Streetscape Master Plan.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The financial crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the lack of access to capital and banking relationships for Black-owned businesses. “According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about 58 percent of Black-owned businesses were at risk of financial distress before the pandemic, compared with about 27 percent of white-owned businesses.” (Forbes.com). 
This proposal focuses on infrastructure projects (streetscapes, facades and broadband) that will revitalize the built environment and provide state-of-the-art technology, to encourage economic growth in an area that is historically significant to the great State of Nebraska.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Summary for Omaha CSA • The $41.6 million in construction activity adds a total of $81.7 million to the local economy. o Includes activity directly related to the construction and associated “spillover” activity. • During the construction of North 24th Street, the construction activity helps support 230 jobs in the construction industry (Direct Employment) and an additional 237 jobs in the community based on the increased economic activity (Indirect/Induced Employment). o Additional workers include real estate, restaurants, engineering services, etc. • The Omaha economy sees a boost to earnings of over $26.8 million for jobs directly related to the construction of the project, additional business-to-business spending, and additional household spending.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 230</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 237</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> North 24th Street BID Infrastructure Improvement Plan intends to pay at or above market rate and Davis Bacon wages to ensure that workers are fairly compensated with a livable, industry rate wages.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Construction job opportunities can be aligned with Metropolitan Community College and other industry trade organization to ensure that there are ready, qualified workers for various industries. Partnership with the Omaha Chamber of Commerce's REACH program is also a method of alignment.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> There are approximately 4,150 residents within the North 24th Street BID and surrounding area: Meredith Ave to Cuming Street from HWY 75 to 20th Street. There are approximately 240 property owners within the BID area from Meredith Ave to Cuming Street. There are five schools within the area with approximately 375 students per school = 1,875. There are approximately seven churches within the North 24th Street Corridor with approximately 100 members per congregation. The communities surrounding North 24th Street along with the greater Omaha metropolitan area will be served by reaping the benefits of: improved infrastructure, better access to transit, increased services and amenities through business development and a reduction in violence and crime.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The BID's primary projects encompass several of the priorities such as: Neighborhoods- promoting safety and security for public spaces and reducing the homicide rate within BIPOC communities; litter control - beautifying the area through regular groundskeeping and advocacy against commercial dumping. Economic Opportunity: improving the physical infrastructure to attract viable businesses and restore the storefronts where small business owners operate; Vibrant Communities: The North 24th Street BID is the first BID in North Omaha, amplifying the voices of Black business leaders and residents who are working to keep pace with the revitalization and investments of Midtown, Downtown and North Downtown.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The City of Omaha is increasing Transit Oriented Development within urban spaces. Improving the current built environment will encourage new, infill building development which will increase the building density and therefore the requirements for TOD. TOD designed spaces will attract people to the area who design more walkable communities and also serve the existing population that relies heavily on transit.</p>
