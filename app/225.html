  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Omaha’s extensive and aging infrastructure bifurcates the community which is a barrier to connecting employers and job seekers together while maintaining the quality of life for North Omaha residents and business owners. 

East-west travel is constrained by the street network as well as bus routing.
 • Highway 75 creates a significant east-west barrier, severing most street connections.
 • Areas north of Arthur Sorensen Parkway have degraded walkability and walk access.

North Omaha has several no-car households and needs multimodal transportation for increased community connectivity resources to foster less car-dependent neighborhoods.
Transit routes that are accessible to employment centers and schools
• Lack of jobs 
•  Failing infrastructure 
• Public transportation only goes so far. Public transit doesn’t meet the needs of the current population.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Public Transit buses and other public transportation were not built to handle communities that are spread out.

East-west travel is constrained by the street network as well as bus routing.
 • Highway 75 creates a significant east-west barrier, severing most street connections.
 • Areas north of Arthur Sorensen Parkway have degraded walkability and walk access.

Omaha’s extensive and aging infrastructure bifurcates the community which is a barrier to connecting employers and job seekers together while maintaining the quality of life for North Omaha residents and business owners. 

Riders The majority of riders live a few miles away from public transit and have no way to and from public transit stops.

Employee Turnover and the lack of reliable transportation are one of the biggest barriers to employee retention

Interview candidates and new hires often don’t show up or quit soon after being hired due to a lack of transportation</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Having affordable and reliable transportation is one of the biggest barriers to employment and higher-paying jobs. Transporter Inc aims to spur growth in the North and South Omaha community by supplementing the bus system with employee carpooling and affordable ride-sharing options for Omaha.

Transporter Inc will connect jobseekers in North and South Omaha to higher paying jobs in West Omaha and Sarpy County. With the recent increase in large companies moving to Nebraska e.g Google, Fedex, Amazon and Meta(Facebook) it is important that we find job seekers to these jobs to spur growth in the community.
Filling jobs with North and South Omaha job seekers will inspire future growth and investment from companies such as Google, Fedex, Amazon and Meta(Facebook)

Employees are looking for more remote jobs to counteract the current rates of inflation along with better perks and benefits.
Employee carpool program allows companies to offer new perks and benefits.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Transport has been recognized as a means to overcome local disadvantages and gain access to better jobs, education, facilities, and services.
inadequate transportation can also increase social isolation and can increase the risk of early mortality, depression, and dementia.

 	Lack of transportation limits opportunities and bars resources. It systematically creates and perpetuates inequality forcing individuals to depend on costly car ownership. Reliable transportation is the single strongest factor in the odds of escaping poverty</p>

Employees can easily leave for emergencies.
