  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Rich Girl, Rich Boy Prep/Legacy Builders is a community revitalization project with the individual in mind. We seek to provide a different approach in terms of problem solving with strategies that are implemented to not only see a need, but also fill it. Our business structure provides wrap around services that aide in the successful completion of programs aimed in breaking generational curses of poverty, changing mindsets and creating generational wealth through homeownership and proper
financial planning.
Our initiative is to provide affordable housing in N. Omaha. Our project consists of rehabbing and development. We will be purchasing 4 distressed properties, rehabbing the properties, and offering affordable rental rates. These families will go through our Legacy Builders program to be prepared to purchase a home with in 24-36 months. 
Our new development will consist of either 4 duplexes or 10 SFR new construction affordable houses in the North Omaha region. Our development will not only provide affordable housing, but most importantly financial support services needed for the family to achieve true financial freedom. Each unit will have 3 bedrooms, 1.5/2 bath with optional finishes such as finished basements, a garage, car port, etc. Each home will be approximately 1200 sq.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> We are looking to start immediately upon funding. We have our team ready with a completion date of 12 months from the start of the project. We will be acquiring landbank properties which are shovel ready. We have been in communication with both land bank and Habitat with parcels of land that are suitable for our development.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our development directly solves two long standing problems that blacks in N. Omaha face: 1) comprehensive holistic financial coaching with a team of experienced professionals and access to affordable housing. We take a full assessment of our participants mindset, skill level, current employment, and vision for the future. Our program addresses mindset training, career development, and creating realistic and achievable financial independence. We then help our clients implement their plan and are engaged with them weekly to ensure they are progressing. A part of our planning is helping them create an additional stream of income within 3-5 years through acquiring their first rental property. Our clients remain in the program until they have reached full financial independence. After they become homeowners, they learn the benefit of taking care of their property (which is their biggest asset) and how leveraging equity can be used as a part of their wealth accumulation strategy.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our project directly addresses the following findings from the Visionary Workshop for N. O:
1. Financial literacy and access
2. Lack of responsibility for community conditions and economic resources
3. Lack of resources
4. Lack of quality entry level housing
5. Lack of thriving black businesses (creating viable businesses is a part of our holistic financial coaching/planning for our families)</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Our reason for existence is to strengthen black families and provide them with a solid financial foundation and assets that can be passed down to future generations. We understand the importance of career development and establishing viable small businesses. Each member of our team has excelled in their careers, in real estate, and in their own businesses.</p>
