  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The North 24th Corridor Project is a multi-node infill real estate development project located along the North 24th St corridor between Ohio St. and Sprague St in North Omaha, Ne. The development concept uses a mixture of large and small multifamily, retail, office, and revitalization plans to enhance the capacity, sustainability and quality of the neighborhoods they will occupy. Total Project scope contains 37,000 sf of commercial space, 90,000 sf of residential space, two rooftop decks, and the revitalization of two 90+ year old structures including the Thomas Funeral Home site. Each node: The Greenwood District (Laird St), Shyvell Development (Wirt St.), Corby Development (Corby St), each has a distinct concept that seamlessly fits with the already existing activities taking place in those areas. The Greenwood district, named after the thriving Black business district bombed during a racial attack in Tulsa, OK, in 1921,  will be a commercial area in the vein of Blackstone and Benson with shops, dining, and entertainment following the steps of the soon developed Greenwood Building at 24th & Laird while also completely renovating the historic Thomas Funeral Home site to above modern quality. The Shyvell Development will focus on community and education with soon to be established Dreamzz Corp., a grassroots focused nonprofit, as a tenant as well as potential others, such as NONA. This approach complements the work of The POC collaborative, Heart Ministries Center, Culxr House, and the Global Leadership Group already established in the area. The Colby Development will strictly focus on 55+ housing with small multifamily builds that expand the offering in the area that has been started by Shannon Heights.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Management House operates under a three point philosophy that reflects its founders professional experience. Spaces, Needs, and Neighborhoods. These three pillars are exemplified in the development approach that will be taken with the North 24th Corridor Project. Space itself is an important factor in the North Omaha community as many areas are riddled with vacant lots and abandoned or poorly maintained structures. The Corridor Project will activate these spaces eliminating large gaps of unused land and structures that may contain unkempt landscape or facades, discarded waste, and dangerous structures that hinder the area  experience of residents and business operators. Need is the approach that not only looks to make profit, but more so to fill gaps that the community requires. North Omaha has been greatly under invested in over many decades, and as a result, has a scarcity of quality community amenities such as food outlets,  entertainment destinations, clothing options, first rate affordable housing for all age groups, family structures and income levels, and other services that much of the needs of everyday travel long distances to be secured. The Corridor project will bring many of these categories to one of the business corridors in the area creating a sustainable environment in the process. Neighborhoods are the most important part in our estimation in any endeavor and the Corridor Project will show this by connecting to its new neighbors in a genuine way. With our background in community organizing, we understand the power community residents have in raising the quality of life for everyone involved. We believe that a person to person conversation is the best way to connect our strategy of door to door knocking, community events, and the direct support of neighborhood initiatives creates a connectivity, not only between institutions like a business and an organization, but between the people that make them up.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> North Omaha Swat Comments: 
Strength Section: “Plethora of vacant buildings, lots to be activated
The North 24th Corridor Project will activate around 10 acres of infill land in the North Omaha Community into necessary resource outlets and affordable housing. In addition the Historic Thomas funeral home has agreed to be a part of the development project and has agreed for Management House to act as developer for their property in the renovation.  
Weaknesses Section: “Lack of commercial and retail business, jobs, restaurants, ect…” 
The Greenwood District nod for the Corridor Project will create a commercial, retal, and entertainment district that will span multiple blocks offering dining, shopping, office space.  
Strength Section: “Neighborhood Associations” 
The Corridor Project has already made strides to start the process of engaging the neighborhood associations Neighborhood Action and fact and the North Omaha Neighborhood Alliance</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> Transformational Change 
With the philosophy that the North 24th Coricor project will apply, an environment that is self-sustaining and self-elevating will allow for new levels of quality of life. By doing this new developers and entrepreneurs will see these nods as opportunities to invest and feed into the momentum that will be started with this project. 
Fundamental Change 
Similar to the above, with the new sustained environment created with the corridor project, the common perception of our community will finally be put to rest. The one size fits all narrative that has been prevalent for decades about North Omaha will be overtaken by a project that shows the future that North Omaha has, created and executed by its natives themselves. 
Long Lasting Economic Growth 
The Corridor Project will be transformational by bringin state of the art structures,  need filling local tenants, and community connectivity while still being accessible to the community that already call North Omaha home. Every part of this project is with the current North Omaha resident in mind to live, work and play.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> 150+ new jobs with wages ranging from entry level to executive level.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 50+ new permanent jobs as a result of the project.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 100+ new temporary or construction jobs as a result of the project.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Entry Level  Skilled Level  Management Level Executive level</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Immediate opportunities will be available to all qualified trade workers and contractors that have the skill and certification to complete work. This is a mandate that Management house has given to all team members that will be hiring subcontractors and the like.  The North 24th Corridor Project will instantly provide job opportunities for long lasting employment in property management, maintenance, retail, hospitality, and other services that will be essential to the “Need'' aspect of Management House’s approach to this project.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The North 24th Corridor Project will be a community benefit in many ways. It will activate empty lots and abandoned, poorly maintained structures, raising the aesthetic and usefulness of the areas. It will provide first rate affordable housing for all age groups, family structures and income levels. It will house needed community services and amenities that will allow residents to shop and play in their own community in a clean and safe environment. And it will connect to the community members in a way that fosters genwin connectivity with person to person engagement that will lead to new ventures in the future.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> The Corridor Project will contribute to community sustainability by focusing on all three levels of community life. The built and unbuilt spaces, the community service/ quality of life needs, and the neighbors themselves. By attacking each aspect simultaneously, you create an inter-supporting, and lifting, environment that is needed for a community to sustain over generations.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The N 24th St Corridor Project brings both best practices and innovative ones to deliver a dynamic project. The mixed use concept of development is a proven concept in bringing activity to a community in a focused way. Examples of this can be seen in our own city with developments like Blackstone near the downtown Omaha area. The mix of living and “play” space in close proximity creates instant energy. The innovative aspect that comes with the project, comes at a necessity with communities like North Omaha. A priority on connecting with the residents themselves in the area where development happens is crucial to the success of the project and the success of the community it operates in. With the substantial disinvestment and in turn the feeling of secondness, skepticizam of any new offerings is not only expected but understandable. A focused and genuine effort in connecting with people in the places that they are and achieving goals as neighbors will see the progress that is wanted.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Creation of job in al wage classes Raise in general activity  Community satisfaction Event Attraction  Increase in spendable dollars</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Foot traffic rate New Job postings  Dollar circulation  New residence count  Resident median income change  Proposed use of North Omaha venues  These metrics can be measured by:  Local data organizations City Government  Census  State Government  The developers themselves  Neighborhood organizations</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, these measurements will act as a catalyst for secondary investment. With the increase of these data points, in the focused locations these developments will be built, the increase in general activity, population, and the rise in spendable dollars, both built development and business activity will rise.  This, whenhen coupled with a focus on neighborhood satisfaction, new investment will only feed into the momentum the 24th St Corridor Project will bring to the area. This new influx of energy will stabilize at this new norme in years to come.</p>

  <h3>DisplacementExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> Corby Development 
This node is located east of Florence boulevard. The neighborhood is entirely residential with both single and multi-family structures, newly developed 55+ community Shannon Heights is located within the node complementing the Corby Developments efforts to provide home to the same demographic.  
Shyvell Development 
Located around 24th and Wirt, the neighborhood is a mix of residential, educational, and civic structures. Notable residents are the POC Collaborative, Heart Ministries Center, The CUES organization, and Sacred Heart Parish and Elementary School. All organizations are in unison on the continued development of the node. Additionally, this area is a outlier from most of the other areas in the community for its high home ownership numbers
The Greenwood District 
Located around 24th and Laird, the Greenwood district will be developed on top of blocks of vacant land on the most notable street in North Omaha. The area already includes the historic Thomas Funeral Home, which has agreed to be developed as a part of this project, the soon to be renovated former Native Omaha building, birthplace of the Native Omaha Days Festival, and the former bar Fuzzies that will be led by the Arry Group. Notably the redevelopment of the former Native Omaha building is currently being undertaken by Management Houses President Kyle Keith and the Founder of the POC collaborative Katrina Adams, with completion in summer ‘23. This is a general commercial zoned district that will see new life after project completion.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> All additional funding source decisions will be finalized by the end of summer 2023. Conversations, in relation to projects, have already occurred with institutional lenders and private investors.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> For development in areas that have a lower income rate, such as the areas that are being targeted in this grant process, all non-debt funding would be considered critical to the success and quality of the project. Unlike most development projects in the City of Omaha, traditional lenders are not able to lend the sums of capital large scale developments take. The rates that are viable to be asked for in these areas can not cover the repayment amounts required by lenders.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> The North 24th St Corridor project is scalable in both philosophy and scope.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> The scalability of the philosophy of the Corridor Project is due to its basic generality. Space, needs, and neighbors are transferable concepts to any community. In the case of an area like North Omaha, there is not a limited number of areas that have available space or a small amount of need that should be met. The Corridor Project will  fulfill these points while connecting to the people around us as well.  The scalability of the scope of this project is apparent. An example of this is a current project that is being developed by us and the founder of the POC Collaborative Resource Center (24th & Wirt), The Greenwood Building. All the ideas used in the Corridor Project have been applied to this project, at a smaller scale. The space is a long vacant building that has been ignored for redevelopment because of the nature of funding for such projects. The needs that it will fill include affordable housing and dining, of which it will be the only breakfast restaurant in a 10 minute radius of site, And since our award of the RFP from the City of Omaha, physical canvassing, phone banking, and neighborhood association attendance have taken place, even before full funding was secured.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The organization's financial commitment will be limited in relation to the scope of the project. This is a project that will be led by members of the North Omaha community, and as this grant proves, individual resources are not vast. This will not limit our ability to complete this project however. As stated before in this application, we have been able to create a compelling development in similar circumstances with the Greenwood Building (24th & Laird)  which will open in the later part of next year inside of the soon to be Greenwood District.</p>
