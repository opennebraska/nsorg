  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The National Women’s Volleyball League (NWVL) is an indoor, team-based, women's professional volleyball league in the United States with Omaha, NE headquarters. Prior to the NWVL, no such league exists despite more than 420,000 high school and collegiate females playing volleyball in the US every year and the global volleyball market valued at 294.9 million with YoY projected increase. California, New York, and Texas have noticed this untapped potential and are moving into the midwest volleyball infrastructure. With the state of Nebraska as a nationwide leader in volleyball and its YoY growth for the last two decades, the NWVL posits Nebraska to maintain and grow its leadership before Texas, California, and New York capitalize from our established ecosystem. Headquarters in Omaha creates a symbiotic relationship between the NWVL and Huskers volleyball, drives nationwide traffic to Omaha, and shifts the impending TX, CA, and NY takeover to an Omaha revenue-generating opportunity for our community. To compete with and prevent other states from continuing advancement at the expense of the midwest, the NWVL has developed a three year plan. 2022: develop brand, deepen research, and advance strategic planning. 2023: procure physical HQ in Omaha, finalize LOIs from midwest city partners, and partner with existing arenas to host NWVL activations. 2024: launch NWVL play. While establishing Omaha as the leader in this space is a timely issue, the particular location within Omaha allows flexibility; the NWVL headquarters has agility to operate from many locations within Omaha while partnering with existing arenas to host volleyball play. To be successful and sustainable, the location needs to be accessible for both community members and tourists, excellent for high-quality video streaming and internet use, and include space for local hires to work as well as for hosting the community for events and youth and team engagement. If current structures do not fulfill these requirements, funds will be utilized to implement.</p>

  <p> NWVL places priority focus on community involvement and input, with particular attention on diversifying the volleyball industry, and includes local business partnerships utilizing models from Angel City Futbol Club and KC Current. Broadband and transit required for NWVL will generate increased demand for community-wide resources and access. Agile ability for NWVL to activate existing vacant building enables revitalization and job opportunities. NWVL is a for-profit business driven by the belief that women should be paid for their work; vision requires intersectional lens, recognizing that without explicit inclusion of Black and Brown women and gender-expansive athletes and fans, it is impossible to enact vision. Potential for NWVL to connect North and/or South Omaha to downtown depending on building assignment through LB1024 funding and lack of displacement required for NWVL to occupy a space. The NWVL involves media and prohibits negative depictions of North and South Omaha. The success of the NWVL requires, encourages, and celebrates community involvement and positive community engagement opportunities. The NWVL adheres to both the needs of mental health and the right to mental wellness while promoting holistic wellness in the forms of physical, mental, and community health.</p>
