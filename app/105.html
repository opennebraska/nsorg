  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Wirt Street Mixed-used Development is located within the Neighborhood Action and Facts (NAAF) area from 24th and Wirt to Ames Streets north to south and 24th to 27th Streets east to west. The primary problems facing the residents of NAAF are: high rates of poverty, unemployment, and deteriorated economic and physical conditions. (City Planning 2016)
The Wirt Street Mixed-used Development will activate the 3106 North 24th Street lot which has been vacant since the 1980s. The three-story new construction will have two residential floors and house 28 mixed-income apartment units. The first-floor commercial level will be marketed to attract necessary amenities to the area (there is potential for outdoor community space, a corner store, coffee shop and/or café). This development will beautify the entire project site with landscaping and lighting, which will promote safety in the area. Site improvements include: clearance of the cement loading dock and building foundation, new sod, and outdoor seating. 
A mixed-income apartment complex will provide housing opportunities for low and middle-income residents alike.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The Wirt Street Mixed-use Development will encourage economic growth and community revitalization. The upgrade and beautification of the three parcels Wirt to Spencer Streets is essential in the continual expansion of revitalization on North 24th Street. Currently, there is an abrupt disruption of development that ends at 24th and Ohio Street.
The finding in the Visioning Workshop identified North 24th Street as a target area for LB1024 and ARPA investment dollars.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The ratio of nonprofit businesses to for profit businesses on the North 24th Street Corridor is disproportionate. A recent count of a listing of organizations on the Corridor indicated that there are roughly 3 nonprofits for every for-business. 
The North 24th Street Corridor needs economic stimulation through the creation of viable for-profit businesses. There is also a need to build more rooftops in order to justify the need for amenities like grocery stores and other basic services.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> There is an anticipation of 75 construction jobs associated with this proposal.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> There is an estimate of 5-15 permanent jobs created. Which include management and maintence of the residential properties and jobs created by the business within the commercial space.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 75</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> This project will pay at or above fair market wages in alignment with federal guidelines for HUD projects.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Collaboration with Metropolitan Community College and construction industry trade unions can help to align proposed jobs for workers in the Qualified Census Tracts.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> It is essential for this area to be revitalized to improve the holistic well-being of the residents in NAAF. This project will serve the residents, business owners and property owners of North 24th Street by demonstrating revitalization at a grassroots level. The renovation of the Wirt Street Mixed-use Development will make a significant statement of revitalization that showcases community, ownership and pride. Many people in urban areas like North 24th Street are fearful that revitalization means the displacement and disenfranchisement of people within the community. the Wirt Street Mixed-use Development where the original owners are a part of the development process, will show that urban renewal does not have to take place at the expense of the people who live in the community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> There are close to 100 acres of vacant lots from HWY 75 to 20th Street, Cuming to Ames, many of which are overgrown and treated as dumping sites. New housing constructions will aid in economic growth by increasing the owner’s equity in the property, while improving the comparable property values of the North 24th Street area. According to a 2017 Omaha World Herald article, properties have experienced an overall “decrease of 8 percent of 20,000 properties in north Omaha.”</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Wirt Street Mixed-use Development can demonstrate innovation by aiding revitalization in a historically African American community, while maintaining African American ownership and building African American wealth without mass displacement.</p>
