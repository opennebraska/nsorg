  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Since 1974, Youth Emergency Services (YES) has assisted youth ages 12-24 experiencing homelessness and near homelessness by providing critically needed resources which support them in their desire to be self-sufficient. YES is the only agency in the Omaha-Council Bluffs Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) solely focused on serving youth experiencing homelessness and near-homelessness. A total of 598 unduplicated youth were served across all of our programs in fiscal year 2022. The services YES provides are vital to the community; assisting youth with housing and self-sufficiency to help stop the cycle of homelessness.   

YES’ core programs include Street Outreach, Emergency Shelter, Transitional Living Program, and Maternity Group Home. The Street Outreach Program provides a vital service to the community and to the residents of YES housing with an array of resources including pantry, laundry and shower facilities, daily meals, clothing, an on-site nurse, case management, mobile pantry, and more. In fiscal year 2022, YES assisted 407 unduplicated youth through its Street Outreach Program; 339 at its drop-in center and 68 through physical street outreach.  

Emergency Shelter services have been offered by YES since it first began in 1974. The program serves youth ages 16 to 20, and focuses on a 30–60-day crisis management plan for each youth. All youth have their own room for maximum safety and comfort. At the beginning of 2022, the Emergency Shelter could only house three youth at any given time. As of October 2022, we have made changes and updates to allow housing for seven youth at one time. The Emergency Shelter served a total of 32 youth in calendar year 2021, and exited 29 youth. Of the 29 exited, seven went to a permanent destination, sixteen to a temporary destination (including six into transitional housing), three to an institutional destination, and three to other destinations. 

The Transitional Living Program (TLP) and Maternity Group Home (MGH), have been offered since 2008. Both programs offer transitional housing for youth and young parents who may not otherwise have access to services and support that helps them gain self-sufficiency. In fiscal year 2022, TLP served a total of 26 youth and MGH served a total of seven mothers and five children. Of those that exited TLP, 77% exited to a safe, stable housing option, 53% established permanent connections, and 79% of youth had improved mental health. MGH saw 75% of its youth receive their high school diploma or GED and 86% had improved mental health. This year, we have increased our TLP capacity from serving 12 to 15 youth. We have also created trauma-informed spaces to support gender-diverse populations. We have nine youth that live on one block, which has improved their relationships with each other and with the community.  

YES believes that all forms of diversity strengthen the quality of our work. In fiscal year 2022, 598 unduplicated youth were served; 59.7% of the youth that accessed our services identified as female, and 1.6% identified as transgender. 48.7% of youth identified as Black, African American, or African; 11.4% identified as multi-racial; 3.6% identified as American Indian, Alaska Native, or Indigenous; 1% identified as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and 1% identified as Asian or Asian American.  

YES has a staff structure and board that reflects diversity. Of the staff that chose to self-identify their race and ethnicity, 17% identified as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. The Board of Directors reflects 33% BIPOC. In January 2022, YES created an admissions team that is diverse and uses objective data for admissions and a collaborative approach. Over the last year, we have reviewed our organizational structure and have created and enhanced positions around strategic planning, finance, human resources, and programming to better support our mission.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The YES Residential Campus Project will bring all of the organization’s services to a single location within a Qualified Census Tract (QCT) South Omaha. The project will involve a renovation and addition to the former Omaha Housing Authority (OHA) administrative office building, located at 536 South 27th Street, which has been vacant for seven years. YES is requesting $10,000,000 in Economic Recovery Act funding for this project. Funds will specifically cover construction costs associated with the 16-bed Emergency Shelter, Teaching Kitchen, Street Outreach Center, Job Readiness, community mental health services space, and administrative offices to support the campus. Planning and fundraising for this project began in April of 2021 and construction will be completed in November of 2024, with full occupancy of the YES Residential Campus by January of 2025.  

This project will allow us to expand our capacity and increase the number of youth served by 300%. Currently, YES’ services are spread throughout the Omaha Metro with all programs separate from one another. This not only creates the ongoing expense of maintaining and staffing seven different locations including the administrative offices, but also tremendous inefficiencies in the delivery of these services. The brand-new housing wing will provide a total of 56 housing units; 28 Transitional Living Program units, 16 Emergency Shelter units, and 12 Maternity Group Home units. The YES administrative offices and Street Outreach Program will occupy the rehabilitated OHA building. The renovated portion of the campus will also include a community space with washers and dryers, showers, a Teaching Kitchen, and a clothing and food pantry. Additionally, the renovated wing will house YES’ Job Readiness Program, mental health and substance abuse counseling, and programming and services provided in partnership with several other local nonprofit organizations. All programs, services, and spaces will be available and accessible to youth residing in the housing wing as well as to youth living off-campus in need of services. At this unified campus, YES will be able to increase physical safety and security, streamline operations, and continue their mission of serving homeless and near-homeless youth.</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The YES Residential Campus Project will bring all of the organization’s services to a single location within a Qualified Census Tract (QCT). This project will allow expansion and increase the number of youth served by over 300%, while only increasing direct operating costs by approximately 35%. The project will involve renovation and addition to the former Omaha Housing Authority (OHA) office building, located at 536 South 27th Street. YES is requesting $10,000,000.00 in Economic Recovery Act funding for this project. Funds will cover construction costs associated with the 16-bed Emergency Shelter, Teaching Kitchen, Street Outreach Center, Job Readiness program space, community and mental health services, and administrative offices for YES and partner organizations.  

Currently, YES’ services are spread throughout the Omaha Metro. This not only creates the ongoing expense of maintaining and staffing seven locations, but also creates tremendous inefficiencies in the delivery of these services. At the new, unified campus, YES will be able to increase physical safety and security, streamline operations, and continue their mission of serving homeless and near-homeless youth.  

The housing wing, which will include 56 housing units; 28 Transitional Living Program units, 16 Emergency Shelter units, and 12 Maternity Group Home units, will comprise the new addition to the currently-standing OHA building. The YES administrative offices and Street Outreach Center will occupy the rehabilitated OHA building. The new Street Outreach Center will continue to provide food, clothing, daily meals, and basic needs. The renovated portion of the campus will also include a community space with laundry facilities, showers, and a Teaching Kitchen. Additionally, the renovated wing will house YES’ Job Readiness Program, mental health and substance abuse counseling, and space and offices for programming and services provided in partnership with other local nonprofit organizations. All programs, services, and spaces will be available and accessible to youth residing in the housing wing, as well as to youth living throughout the community who are in need of services.  

The site will also allow for increased capacity to provide more housing and services. The Emergency Shelter now serves seven youth at one time, compared to only three at the start of 2022. In September 2022, 42 youth have inquired about the Emergency Shelter, but only 11 youth were provided housing due to capacity restrictions. At the Residential Campus, we will be able to increase the number of our shelter beds to 16, increasing the yearly average from 60 youth to 192. 

Programming and services will be available through current and future partnerships with other local nonprofit organizations that will have the opportunity to have on-site office space. Through a current partnership with Lutheran Family Services, youth are able to meet with an on-site therapist once per week. Our ultimate goal is to have a full-time, permanent mental health therapist on staff. The Visiting Nurse Association and Nebraska AIDS project will continue to provide health and testing services.  

To address food insecurity, the campus will have raised garden beds where youth can garden and incorporate the food into daily meals. The Teaching Kitchen will provide space for cooking and food preparation classes, and offer opportunities to collaborate with partners. The Teaching Kitchen will be commercial-grade so that churches, business groups, and volunteers can safely and efficiently prepare daily meals served out of the Street Outreach Center. 

The YES Residential Campus Project is at the shovel-ready phase. Planning and fundraising for this project began in April 2021. Anticipated construction completion is November 2024, with full occupancy by January 2025.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The YES Residential Campus Project will involve an adaptive reuse of land in South Omaha that holds existing, but dated, infrastructure. The OHA building has stood vacant for seven years. The YES Residential Campus Project will bring vitality back to the site and provide increased visibility for the variety of programs and services that YES offers. Additionally, the building is located along a well-traveled corridor where several other youth-serving organizations currently reside, including Together, Completely KIDS, and CASA for Douglas County. Not only will YES be able to provide services out of one, centralized location, but we will also have greater opportunities to work in partnership with these organizations to meet the needs of youth and the wider community.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The YES Residential Campus Project is aligned with LB1024’s strategic priority of funding projects that will create sweeping economic growth in South Omaha through investments in housing and housing services. The 56-bed housing wing will bring additional affordable housing to the South Omaha community and will help to offer housing for youth experiencing homelessness or near-homelessness. The Emergency Shelter with 16 units, Street Outreach Center, Job Readiness Program, Teaching Kitchen, health services, and programs will offer youth living in the housing wing and in the community a full range of support and resources in one, accessible location.  

Rehabilitation of OHA building, which has stood vacant for seven years, will help to revitalize the area between 24th and 28th and St. Mary’s Avenue, where other critically-needed social services organizations Together, Completely KIDS, and CASA for Douglas County are also headquartered. The new campus will also provide previously non-existent job opportunities to local Small and Emerging Businesses for maintenance, landscaping, snow removal, and cleaning services.  

Located within a Qualified Census Tract in South Omaha, the project is at the shovel-ready stage and is expected to be completed in November of 2024, with full occupancy of the YES Residential Campus by January of 2025.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> YES anticipates adding five full-time positions once the project is completed. This includes a Housing Leasing Agent, Facilities Maintenance Technician, two shelter staff, and one Street Outreach Program staff member. We will prioritize small business owners when contracting with external lawn care, snow removal and cleaning services.

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> It is YES’ intent to employ facility vendors and contractors from Small and Emerging Businesses within the immediate neighborhood and Qualified Census Tracts. For the construction project, Lund-Ross Constructors’ goal is to have 10% of the scope of work awarded to Small and Emerging Small Business (SEB) contractors. This would indicate at least 12-14 jobs created in the SEB community.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The location of the existing building included in the YES Residential Campus Project has been vacant for seven years. YES will bring life back to the building, create a positive relationship with the current neighborhood, and employ community-based vendors and contractors. At this new location, the expanded Emergency Shelter space will house youth in a trauma-informed space with peers of their own age, access to mental health and medical services, HIV and STI testing, educational opportunities, and basic needs such as clothing and food.  

YES will have significantly increased space and capacity for addressing immediate housing needs for youth. At the beginning of 2022, our Emergency Shelter could only house three youth at any given time. As of today, we can adequately house seven youth at one time. While there has been improvement, we are still falling far short of being able to serve youth due to current capacity restrictions. In September of 2022, 42 youth have inquired about the Emergency Shelter. Out of those 42, we were only able to house 11 youth. At the Residential Campus, we will be able to increase the number of our shelter beds to 16. The potential for increased capacity has also spurred conversations with Radius and the Douglas County Youth Center to explore how YES could provide Emergency Shelter and Transitional Living services to nonviolent youth offenders.   

The Residential Campus will allow all services to be provided in one centralized location so that youth living in the YES Emergency Shelter, Transitional Living, and Maternity Group Home housing units will not have to travel off-site to receive services. Youth not currently housed on campus will also have access to basic needs through the Street Outreach Center, which provides food, clothing, daily meals, and a computer lab. Laundry and shower facilities will also be available at the Street Outreach Center. 

To address food insecurity, the campus will have raised garden beds where youth can grow their own produce and incorporate them into daily meals prepared out of the Teaching Kitchen. The Teaching Kitchen will provide space for cooking and food preparation classes and offer opportunities to bring partners in to work with youth. YES is in very preliminary discussions with No More Empty Pots regarding working together out of this space. Furthermore, the Teaching Kitchen will be commercial-grade so that churches, business groups, and community volunteers can safely and efficiently prepare daily meals served out of the Street Outreach Center. 

In the rehabilitated portion of the campus, there will be dedicated space for the Job Readiness Program, mental health counseling, health services through the Visiting Nurse Association and Nebraska AIDS Project, and legal services provided by Legal Aid of Nebraska. Through the Job Readiness Program, youth learn practical skills to maintain and stay with their jobs to achieve self-sufficiency. Mental health services will be an important component at the new campus. Group and individual therapy will be available to help youth understand and cope with their possible diagnoses and help to stabilize them while they are residing on site. YES’ ultimate goal is to hire a full-time, permanent staff member to administer mental health counseling and services. Currently, we contract with Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska for these services.  

YES also plans to maximize our efforts to engage with the Omaha Public Schools liaison for the McKinney-Vento program so that youth can work on educational goals and attainment such as completing their GED. There will also be non-dedicated space available and open to future partnerships with agencies that serve youth.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a chronically homeless person costs the taxpayer an average of $35,578 per year. At its new location, YES will be able to serve far more youth for far less than the annual taxpayer cost and continue to work to reduce future homelessness by providing all participants with intensive case management, healthcare, employment and life skills, and resources to improve their current and future quality of life, and encourage them to be engaged citizens. These efforts, in turn, will ultimately disrupt the generational cycle of homelessness.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> YES has been serving youth ages 12-24 who are experiencing homelessness and near-homelessness since 1974 and is the only agency in the Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA solely focused on serving youth experiencing homelessness and near-homelessness. Once the YES Residential Campus Project is complete, youth living on the campus will receive case management, group instruction, gateway services, pantry, laundry facilities, job readiness instruction, and other resources and services on site. Youth living in the wider community will also be able to access the Street Outreach center for food, clothing, other support, as well as YES community programs. This will allow youth to receive more intensive support, easier access to resources, and more efficiency in program execution.   YES follows a trauma-informed approach across all of its housing programs, tailoring all case plans to each individual youth. YES believes that addressing youth homelessness is critical to all communities so that youth can focus on their next steps, including education, employment, life skill development, and eventually, a transition plan into their own home, ideally within the community.   Many of the youth who benefit from our programs and services are considered high risk. Specifically, we have a number of youth who have a history of being trafficked. Therefore, safety and security are a continual high priority. At the Residential Campus, we will house a Human Trafficking Advocacy Ambassador to support youth. Additionally, all units will be monitored by 24-hour staff. Cameras will also be installed to ensure top level security. We will invest in adequate lighting for the premises, including the parking lots. Key cards and fobs will be required to access the housing wing and administrative offices. The Street Outreach Center and community space will remain open and available to the public during operating hours.   YES is also pursuing accreditation through the Council on Accreditation (COA), specifically for homeless services. The anticipated completion of accreditation is calendar year 2023.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Moving all programs, services, and administration to one campus will quickly enable us to serve significantly more youth than we are currently able to across several locations. In the Emergency Shelter alone, the increase from seven to 16 shelter beds will allow us to go from housing an average of 60 youth per year to an estimated average of 192 youth per year. Anticipated short-term program outcomes are to have 80% of youth in the housing programs receive health services and 80% access our mental health services. Upon exiting our programs, we anticipate that 80-85% of youth will have a job and/or enroll in school, and 100% will exit to safe and secure housing. In the long-term, we anticipate that youth will leverage the support and life skills gained from YES programming and services and be contributing members to the community for the duration of their lives. YES will also continue to measure federally-outlined short-term, intermediate term, and long-term outcomes for youth within the housing programs located at the new campus. Short-term Outcomes: Self-sufficiency matrix score will improve by 15% within the first 90 days for 60% of youth; The composite score for health will improve from entry for 60% of youth within the first 90 days; 50% of youth will report having one positive adult in their life within the first 90 days; Self-sufficiency matrix score will improve for Family and Social Relationships within the first 90 days for 60% of youth; 80% of youth will be enrolled and attending school, actively working, or actively participating in the equivalent in job readiness or community service; 100% of youth will be in safe housing within the Transitional Living Program and will be working with their case managers on transition plans to exit to safe, stable housing. Intermediate Outcomes: The self-sufficiency matrix will improve by 30% or more for youth that remain in the program for six months or longer; 80% of youth will report having one positive adult in their life upon program exit; Self-sufficiency matrix score will improve for Family and Social Relationships; 70% of youth will have graduated or obtained a GED upon program exit; 75% will be employed or seeking gainful employment upon exit; 90% of youth will transition to safe, stable housing upon program exit. Long-term Outcomes: Youth report continuing to maintain positive adult support six months to one year after discharge from our program; Youth continue to pursue education and gainful employment goals six months to one year after discharge; Youth maintain safe and secure housing six months to two years after discharge.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> Program case managers will collect data on an on-going basis to measure short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes. Youth self-report data through self-sufficiency matrices that gauge their current level of life skills, well-being, connections, permanency, communication, etc. Each youth within the housing programs completes a self-sufficiency matrix upon intake, every three months while in the program, and upon program exit. Case managers follow up with youth one month, three months, six months, one year, and two years after discharge.</p>

  <h3>PhysicalLocation</h3>
  <p> After project completion, the YES administrative offices and Street Outreach Program will occupy the former OHA administrative office building, located at 536 South 27th Street, Omaha, NE 68105. The building has been vacant for seven years. The housing wing of the YES Residential Campus Project will be contained in a new four-story structure, to be to be located between 27th and 28th Streets, north of St. Mary’s Avenue in Omaha. The new wing will be attached as an addition to the existing OHA building. The need for affordable units within the neighborhood that this campus will occupy is extremely high.  By 2023, an estimated 225 homeless youth households, 16 to 21 years of age, will reside in the Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA. This will include an estimated 198 single person youth households and 27 homeless youth households with children.</p>

  <h3>GeneralContractorPublicCompetitiveBidWhyNot</h3>
  <p> In the initial stages, several general contractors were considered. Lund-Ross Constructors was quickly selected due to their experience and expertise in this specific type of construction and rehabilitation project. Lund-Ross has a track record of transparency, high community engagement, and commitment to sub-contracting with minority-owned and Small and Emerging Businesses.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> The amount requested of $10,000,000 will fund three essential elements of YES Residential Campus Project, in the Street Outreach Program, the Emergency Shelter, Job Readiness, Teaching Kitchen, and administrative and community offices that support those programs. These programs will provide the highest level of support to the surrounding community and provide a tremendous level of community impact.  The requested amount is specifically tied to the cost to construct the space in which these programs will be housed.  The attached chart illustrates a breakdown of those costs, based on percentage of construction costs.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The YES Residential Campus Project will provide a multitude of services that support individuals across all levels of the home insecurity spectrum.  The funds received from this grant will be focused on programs and activities that directly support youth in the local community that need housing services.  The following is a list of the programs that will be directly funded with these grant funds. 

-  Emergency Shelter 
-  Street Outreach 
-  Teaching Kitchen 
-  Job Readiness 
-  Administrative Offices for Program Staff 

The specific funding needs for each of these programs is listed in the Data Table of Uses, please refer to the grant application attachment with that detail.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> No</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The YES Residential Campus Project is unique, because it will triple the number of youth served, while only increasing the Youth Emergency Services annual operating budget by 10%.  YES is able to accomplish this incredible service value, because the current housing services they provide are spread out across several leased properties, over a wide geographic footprint.  By consolidating all housing services and staff within one campus, YES will realize significant savings in the cost categories of personnel, transportation, and property costs.     While the increase in operational costs is minimal because of this consolidation, the organization is still taking prudent steps to ensure that funding is in place for future cost increases and unforeseen costs.  Those steps include the creation of a maintenance reserve fund for the new facility, an operational reserve fund for initial operating costs, and the bolstering of donor management efforts to ensure long term operational funding.  The financial details around these steps can be observed in the project budget and operating proforma.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> In order to obtain successful completion of this project and implementation of programming, we will need all funds to be awarded.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> The YES Residential Campus Project does not have the ability to easily scale up, as the design process has progressed to the point in which increasing the scope of the project would result in a significant increase in design costs.  However, if there is a long-term need for expansion, there are options for an additional structure on the property.  If services needed to be expanded in a long-term scenario, we would review options for scalability within the campus.   There is not an option to scale down the project in any way, as the existing designs and scope of 40 affordable units, have been submitted for Low Income Housing Tax Credits.  Once those LIHTC credits are approved, then the project scope is essentially locked in, to properly fulfill the LIHTC project.</p>
