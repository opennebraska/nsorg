  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> As a newer organization, we have launched the DIY studio out of Hot Shops Art Center. So far we have had a successful launch of offering various types of creative workshops or a wide range of ages. As part of our organizational goal, we are exposing the community to local artists while adding to artist financial sustainability.  People with varying creative experience can learn from local artists in a way that is non-intimidating. I am watching an appreciation for creativity grow as well as artist support.</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Combination of capital project and service/program</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> West Omaha has numerous established creative DIY-centered businesses. North and South Omaha lacks these creative opportunities for all ages. The plan is to create numerous locations that reflect the neighborhoods they are planted within north and south Omaha. There is a diversity to creativity that the community needs education and exposure to in a way that is non-intimidating. This includes fine arts, literary arts and cultural arts including culinary and beauty. The Creative Impulse plans to partner with local artists and businesses in these areas to do the following: Increase access to creative opportunities, increase exposure to different creative mediums, increase exposure to local artists, support artist and cultural sustainability, create jobs as well as provide training in the creative arts. The first locations we are focused on launching physical spaces within are Benson and North 24th street. We will begin with a brick and mortar space in Benson in 2023 due to its new identity and continuing growth as a Creative District. Out of increasing partnerships we should be in position to begin the launch of new location in 2025. By 2027, we should be on track to have 1 more location added in south Omaha. The Creative Impulse will build up awareness in each of these communities and neighbors thought partnerships with local business using a pop-up model.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> In north and south Omaha we currently have a limited amount of support in artist sustainability. We are creating opportunities in which artists are able to be paid a fair wage in order to continue in cultivating and passing on culture through art. Many are competing for the same funds to support their projects and livelihood. There has been a limited view of how artists can draw in income. With The Creative Impulse model, artists will be able to draw in income through instruction and exposure to creative services they provide. We provide instructor training and professional mentoring for anyone who joins our group of artists. We will create experiences inviting people into locally owned spaces in north and south Omaha through partnerships. This will also include highlighting delicious food by local vendors as well. The model is designed to create jobs, provide professional art career mentoring increase appreciation for art, and add value to those who participate in the workshops.  The Creative Impulse is here to help artists stay in Omaha and give people with an interested in creativity the opportunity to create.  Our focus is to use local and BIPOC owned business for all contractor work. It is important it keep pouring back into the communities and making sure that each brick-and-mortar space reflects the culture and needs of the communities they inhabit.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal is an answer to many of the findings from the Visioning Workshop.  There is land and building sitting unused with ownership outside of the community. The hope is the be able to take back and utilize these spaces with a boutique DIY studio model. We can have as many of these studios as there is demand in different neighborhoods. They will serve as spaces for special events surrounding creativity. Different celebrations can be hosted in these spaces while employing local artists to instruct and lead. Local artists and creatives goods will be on sale on consignment which will continue to send money back into the community.  We will have jobs available for instructors and assistants and office workers. We will be employing north and south Omaha businesses and other BIPOC-owned businesses for contract work and other vendor needs for workshop events. 
We will be supporting the community through different partnerships with local businesses and popping up in their spaces, not only within our brick-and-mortar spaces. We hope to be a go-to for business exposure as well creative fun for the community. 
Our locations will be within walking distance and located in business districts to make them easily accessible. We will also be intentional and mindful of different forms of accessibility issues.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This proposal aligns with and responds to the need to assist artist entrepreneurs in their goals to grow or launch their businesses. Through the exposure gained in addition to the livable wage they receive from instructing workshops, artists will be assisted in with their entrepreneurial goals. Employment will also come in the form of art assistance, social media and communication needs. Assistants will not only help with art workshops, they will also have the opportunity to create and fill orders for DIY Kits specifically branded by The Creative Impulse.  We will provide mentoring for the artists with less experience with instruction and building their art business.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> We are planning to compensate instructors with both an hourly and profit split option. Based on the projected average amount of events we will have in our first year, we have come up with the following number for wages:


Artist Instructors will be contracted and paid $50 per hour for an average of 3 hours coming to a minimum of $150 per workshop event. Depending on if the instructor is on temporarily or permanently will determine how much their wage comes to that year. This is well above the average of $30 or less in most instruction-based organizations. 

Art Assistants will be paid starting at $15 per hour for an average of 5 hours coming to a minimum of $75 per shift. Art Assistants can always work their way up to be Artist Instructors and schedule flexible hours in managing the space and events.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Over the span of the proposal we will have permanent at least 2 permanent positions is created for assisting in managing the space on a regular basis at each location. That will be at least 6 permanent jobs in the next 5 years.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Over the span of the proposal we will average about 13 temporary positions per location which comes to about 40 positions in the next 5 years.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> These job wage levels will be fair wage rates.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> Immediate income will come from having artists already instructing classes in pop up locations withing the Qualified Census Tracts. Local and BIPOC contractors will also be engaged immediately when the brick-and-mortar spaces are obtained to renovate and prepare the spaces for the DIY Workshops.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The Creative Impulse is designed to create an opportunity for people of all ages to engage in art and creativity in a way that is affordable and non-intimidating. Participants will have their creative value built as well as cultivate appreciation for the artistic process. There will be fun opportunities to engage in including homeschooling art programs, workshops for the aging, weaving and sneaker design workshops.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> This proposal is focused on adding to community sustainability by creating engaging creative experiences that draw people from outside of the community as well as within it. The Creative Impulse will not only increase value in participants lives but will also provide a stable stream of income for local artists and makers.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Creative Impulse is an innovative concept for the city of Omaha. It follows a pop-up model as well as a brick and mortar model that keeps the community’s wants and needs for creativity in mind. The multiple locations that will reflect the culture and vibe of its neighborhood is different. There will be plans that include the ability to instruct a wide range of cultural and fine art workshops. Each location will highlight food and beverage items highlighting local vendors.</p>
