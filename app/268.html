  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Food is the heart of any urban culture. The North Omaha Food Hall & Indoor Greenspace will create a place for small business owners and community to collide. We will work with the city to choose a location and build a multi functional environment designed to bring jobs and revenue to North Omaha while also creating a beautiful and safe space for residents to gather, shop, walk, eat, be entertained. 

The Food Hall provides stalls (10-12)  for many small businesses to display their culinary skills while highlighting the many different cultures the live, grow, and thrive  in Omaha, NE.  Ideally we want to bring a small produce space as well ensuring fresh food is available to the residents of the area. We also envision retail or commercial spaces allowing for other businesses to benefit from the increased traffic.  

The indoor green space provides visitors with places to sit, gather, and work. Spaces for artist to perform and small communities to meet. This multifunctional space gives residents and reason to come and stay in the area. 

This project has the potential to bring hundreds of jobs to North Omaha while impacting the entire area economically and socially.</p>
