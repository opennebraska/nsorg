  <h3>OrganizationalChart</h3>
  <p> Omaha North Corps Community Center is part of the Omaha Area Command led by Divisional Commander Major Greg Thompson and Major Adam Moore (chart 1).  The organization chart for Omaha North Corps Community Center (chart 2) shows current staffing and proposed expansion, and includes the campaign cabinet.  We have also provided our Omaha Advisory Board list.

We will hire the Operations Director during the construction phase so they can oversee space usage and staffing, and participate in program development.</p>

  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> Programmatically, The Salvation Army of Omaha is a non-profit business entity, employing more than 300 persons, including ten at North Corps Community Center.  It provides approximately 100,000 non-duplicated service units annually to people struggling with intergenerational, situational, and relative poverty in the Omaha metro, including tens of thousands at North Corps Community Center.

Capital projects in recent years have invested approximately $100 million for the Kroc Center project in South Omaha (opened 2010) and The Renaissance Village project, at our primary social service campus on Cuming Street, which opened in 2017. 

Renaissance Village includes 47 fixed income housing units for seniors and Heritage Place, which includes 33 apartments, some dedicated to those with significant mental health challenges.</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Facility expansion and enhancement will create a 34,000 sq.ft. space with new flexible classroom/meeting spaces, modernized community/service space, and gymnasium/weight room, purposefully designed to support each stage of individual and community rehabilitation and success.  

A combination of new construction and renovation will create an attractive addition to the North 24th Corridor, featuring a business incubator model supported by business and community partners, job search assistance, recruitment activities, business mentorship, and training; and co-working space for use by entrepreneurs, business leaders, and students.  We will include flexible, technologically enabled meeting spaces of different sizes, modern classrooms that support youth development, GED and college-level classes, and community meetings.  These will exist alongside spaces to support expanded holistic youth wellness and sports programs, with a special new emphasis on serving females ages pre-school through high school, robust case management program, free opportunities for residents to address health needs and build community, after-school youth development and recreation, and provision of basic needs support without which many would struggle to survive.

The Salvation Army Board and executive leadership have identified capital improvement for the North Corps Community Center, located at 24th and Pratt, in the center or North Omaha QCTs, as its top priority in Omaha.  Omaha North Corps was built as a temporary facility in the 1960s to address immediate community needs.  It is too small to permit modern, relational human services work, and through overuse and aging has fallen into disrepair.  Officers and staff cannot perform the sustained engagement that helps people lift themselves out of intergenerational poverty, and find themselves struggling just to address the short-term needs of a growing client base.

We are determined to enhance the North 24th Street corridor through this project and are working with an Omaha-based architect firm to design an efficient, attractive space that will open in the fall of 2024.  We are seeking $20 million from a combination of local philanthropists and ARPA LB1024 funds to help us unleash the potential of North Omaha citizens that we have supported for almost 70 years.</p>

  <h3>FundingGoals</h3>
  <p> Fundamental Change (i.e., a proposal that will continue to elevate North or South Omaha's presence and perception within the region, significantly improving the lives of area residents through physical development)
Long-Lasting Economic Growth (i.e., a proposal that will foster gainful employment opportunities and financial investment in the area, leading to the creation of generational wealth and widespread economic vitality in North and South Omaha)
Transformational (i.e., a proposal that will help energize, recharge, or spur significant and favorable advancements in North or South Omaha's function or appearance)</p>

  <h3>Community Needs</h3>
  <p> Multimodal Transportation (i.e., enable connectivity through driving, biking, taking transit, walking, and rolling)
Other Infrastructure (i.e., develop or improve broadband, business districts, roadways, sewer, etc.)
Policy (i.e., develop or improve context-sensitive education, finance, health, training, zoning, etc.)
Quality of Life (i.e., create or enhance natural spaces, mixed uses, parks, safety, etc.)
Sustainable Community (i.e., create or enhance housing, services, education, civic uses, recreation, etc.)</p>

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Sustainable Community.  Providing space for entrepreneurs and others to conduct business and identify opportunities, employers to hire and train, after-school activities that build youth ability and esteem while allowing parents to work, and sophisticated case management to help people envision, prepare for and sustain a better life.
Multi-modal Transportation.  Relocate bus stop to our location and build a shelter, identify to the community as a safe place to meet ride-hailing services, invest in secure bike storage for facility users.
Other Infrastructure.  Provide a space with superior internet capability, technologically enhanced meeting rooms, and ability to train all for digital life.
Quality of Life.  After-school programs that engage students in safe, supervised play and education enhancement, improved playground and creation of indoor and outdoor walking paths and other recreation opportunities.
Policy.  Through our programs and partnerships, increase access to budgeting, parenting, and life-planning information while making health management a free, community-wide project.

This proposal aligns ideally with the community needs defined above. Due to facility constraints at Omaha North Corps Community Center, we have been responding primarily to basic needs for most of those we serve in North Omaha.  The impact of this project will initially be improved, outcome-based service for all programs and services currently in place, and new programs and services when the building is expanded.  Many of the people we serve need additional support in order to be ready to participate fully in the goals of LB 1024. Our work to address personal challenges that have kept them from exiting poverty, then financial management and preparation for better jobs and careers, is hindered due to the facility limitations.  Our ongoing support of the family through needs assistance, after school programming, recreation, and community engagement, we will release economic potential in each client.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> These are the identified SWOT values our proposal addresses:
•	Strengths.  Culture and character are integrated into the neighborhoods – we are already part of the culture of North Omaha, a trusted partner for people as they work to improve their lives.  Economic hubs proximate to North Omaha – through advisory board and business relations, we are also deeply connected to Omaha’s business and philanthropic communities and have identified new partners to support North Omaha economic development
•	Weaknesses.  Economic investment does not recycyle – the Pathway of Hope, is a case management model aimed at helping people build and sustain wealth-generating lives.  Broadband and public infrastructure do not meet current needs – our new facility will be fully broadband capable and will permit students to do homework online, entrepreneurs to fill online bids or print invoices, and presentations of many types.
•	Opportunities.  Vacant parcels and availability of land – our project creates new space for programming and connects that to a rehabilitated older facility.  Leverage current residents and entrepreneurial efforts into additional economic activity – our space and technology will support co-working and meeting space for all business types. 
•	Threats.  Aging infrastructure is a barrier – our new campus, including the renovated space, will have modern, upgraded utilities, and will be an attractive part of North 24th Corridor growth.  Negative external media/perception – we have exceptional media relationships and will continue to tell the story of the proud, innovative, and innately good people of North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This project aligns ideally with the LB1024’s strategic priorities of Transformation, Fundamental Change, and Long-Lasting Economic Growth.  Though our proposal seeks funds for a building, our investment is in the people of North Omaha, with whom we have partnered for generations.

The capacity that can support business activity also supports education attainment, for adults and children, and community building activities – all drivers of long-lasting economic growth.  By dedicating space for medical triage and providing free access to sports and recreation activities, we foster community health – using a physical development of property to spur development of physical health.  With our commitment to Pathway of Hope, a case management model of delivering social services that features referral to Salvation Army and partner programs, we express faith in each person’s value, help people rebuild their lives, and empower people to become productive citizens – that is personal and community transformation.  

Finally, our mission states that we will meet human need without discrimination and we will continue to love and provide material assistance to all who come to us – a box of groceries helps a family stay in their home, rent and utility assistance helps others afford medical care.  This work is economic development, because it buys time for people, some too beaten by circumstance and others just not yet ready to change, to realize, accept and invest in their special purpose and unique richness.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> Once complete this facility will require an additional nine FTE and PT positions; it also makes possible significant expansion of STEP UP! Omaha  and other youth employment and leadership opportunities at key youth engagement times (summer, school breaks). 

The Salvation Army’s A Way to Work (in partnership with the City of Omaha) and Pathway of Hope programs prepare clients for employment and provide access to ongoing mentorship related to job and career growth.  Working with partners such as Heartland Workforce Solutions, the Omaha Chamber’s REACH, National Able, and others we will serve as a hub for those in 68111 and neighbor zip codes as they seek and prepare for work.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> The initial projection is 9 new jobs, but in future years we will add staff as needed to achieve our long-term objective of helping residents of North Omaha realize their full God-given potential.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> 150 to 200 jobs will be created during the construction phase.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> Some of the new positions within the facility are hourly jobs that pay between $15 and $25 per hour.  The Director of Operations will be a salaried position, with compensation starting at $75,000 per year.  We will prioritize two significant goals with this hire:  s/he will know and be known in the North Omaha communities we serve, and s/he will be hired before or during construction, so that s/he can immerse in space usage, final design, and related issues.  All Salvation Army positions come with access to health and other standard benefits.  The wages for construction jobs will run between $20 (or more) per hour for laborers and $45-$50 per hour for skilled contractors – electricians, plumbers, etc., all depending on demand at the time.  To support the community we serve, our intent is to hire “local” for construction and construction support jobs.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> In addition to the new positions required to run the facility and programs, our job-related partnerships can begin immediately.  These include presence by a representative of Heartland Workforce Solutions and free space for REACH mentor meetings.  Simultaneously, area entrepreneurs and increasingly mobile business people will be invited to share co-working spaces, conduct online operations, convene groups, conduct interviews and post positions at the facility.  As well, Pathway of Hope case work will create links to partner agencies as it helps clients select among best job and career options, and mentors them as they apply and interview for opportunities.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> Because of the limitations of the current North Corps, the Salvation Army has had to limit its work to responses that cannot create lasting change – short-term support for people struggling with multi-generational or situational poverty.  Our new facility, with spaces dedicated to workforce opportunities, better health, and youth development will permit us to shift to helping people reclaim and recover their lives.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> We will be able to engage as many as three times the number of children in a safe, character-building, play-centered community that supports education attainment – which helps parents commit fully to work.  This project can bring premier exercise opportunities for free to 25-40% more adults who are struggling with obesity and related health concerns, including mental and behavioral health challenges.  We will also be able to expand our case management program, Pathway of Hope, and provide an experience that celebrates the dignity of each person and family.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The Pathway of Hope is the Salvation Army’s flagship program for guiding and supporting families as they move out of intergenerational poverty.  It launched nationally a decade ago with major funding from the Lilly Endowment, Inc. and is a research-proven approach to aiding all people in need.  This approach combines strengths-based case management, holistic support, spiritual and emotional guidance, and focus on personal growth.  North Corps participants will have access to all of the nationally accredited social service programs offered by the Army in Omaha.  Program best practices have been verified by the Loyola University Center for Research on Self-Sufficiency.  These findings concluded that Pathway casework stimulates higher initial response regarding readiness for change, increases in Hope and Self-Sufficiency Matrix scores, and demonstrates the benefits of simultaneous social service support and pastoral care for those who choose this.  Data is stored in SIMS, a secure, nationally recognized social services system, for later analysis.    Pathway clients cite employment and income, and shelter, as top challenges, and through the program gain access to food and shelter, job training and legal services, education and transportation, and health services and childcare.  More than half of clients remain in the program for longer than one year, learning budgeting skills, parenting techniques, goal-setting and self-motivation.  Of those who agreed to complete post-graduation surveys, 92% reported increased hope for a brighter future, 81% rated their case management Very Good or Excellent, and 74% reported positive change in their children.  We would expect North Corps results to be as good or better.  Despite inadequate space, there is a trained case manager working with families at Omaha North Corps.  When the new facility opens, dedicated space and access to on-site amenities that support personal growth will create an environment in which Pathway of Hope can increase numbers served and program success by 3 to 5 times current rates.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> As with the Pathway of Hope model, the Salvation Army creates and measures outcomes for all facilities and client engagement.  At this point in our planning, we are studying needs stated by the community and outputs we can achieve, and will then develop outcomes.  At a minimum, we know that our work in this new facility will provide a safer environment for families, better access to services and employment opportunities, and case work to help people escape poverty and live the lives they deserve.  Facility usage.  We believe this new facility allow us to engage as many as 200 youth per day, an increase over the 60 to 80 currently involved.  Currently, about 1,400 adults participate in facility activities and services each week – we expect that number can grow to at least 2,000.  Economic Development.  The current facility supports only the most sporadic job search and training, and entrepreneur engagement.  We anticipate the new facility will sustain 35-50 hours of co-working activity each week, while offering satellite office space for employment agencies with whom we partner and small business coaching.  It will also host quarterly (perhaps more frequent) job fairs.  Health and Education Outcomes.  Top needs cited in August 2022 by current facility users include after-school tutoring, better access to healthcare options and support in applying for those, free, safe structured recreation for youth and adults, and more leadership opportunities for youth.  We are developing outputs in all areas and believe we can increase engagement in these areas by 2 to 5 times current levels.  This is especially true with partnerships already discussed (and beginning) with The Learning Community and Metro Community College to improve access to education support for adults and children.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> The Salvation Army assesses high-level effectiveness of all corps and community centers through an internal process called STEP, an acronym for Strategic Tool to Engage Potential.  As we expand Pathway of Hope, we will be able to take advantage of assessment procedures for that program offered by our Territorial Command office. We will also designate a portion of private philanthropy to engaging an external partner to assess client satisfaction and program effectiveness.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> The Salvation Army is currently the sole financial entity in this project.  In most cases, commitment from The Salvation Army to a community encourages others to invest and we are happy to partner with them.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> For enhanced economic development in North Omaha, and ultimately new and better jobs’ creation, this project requires an enhanced facility and stronger programs. We believe it is a $20 million project and are confident that private funders will contribute  at least $10 million to the project.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> The Salvation Army will direct LB 1024 grant funds awarded toward construction, renovation and site improvement, and private funds will offset remainder of those costs and fund enhanced and expanded programming and service.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The Salvation Army is fortunate to have built over the past five decades a broad base of annual supporters who this past fiscal year donated over $6 million for programs and operations in the Omaha metro.  We are confident that current funders will continue supporting our annual operating needs, including increased cost for programs at Omaha North Corps.  Furthermore, major funders have told us they will consider investing additional program funding if North Corps expands its programming and strengthens it staffing.  The Salvation Army directs an annual allocation from the $6 million in mostly non-designated funds it raises through the Tree of Lights Campaign, DJ’s Hero Awards and other development activities to its local programs, including those at the North Corps Community Center.  The Salvation Army will increase its current allocation from the general fund to cover additional costs, plus the development department will continue soliciting funds that will be designated to North Corps.   Most funding for North Corps is derived from private sources, with less than 5% of North Corps Community Center’s funding obtained from government funding.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> Our capital campaign leadership – Fred Hunzeker, Mike Cassling, Dr. Viv Ewing, and Carl Mammel – is leading us in the initial, “silent” phase of our North Corps Campaign.  Once launched, we will solicit approximately $10 million of private funding for the building project, plus additional funds for programming at Omaha North Corps from approximately 20 major funders, many of whom have supported previous capital projects and provide annual programming support.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> We have already held meetings with most of our prospective funders and have told them that we will formally apply for funding as soon as our facility plan is completed, which should be in November of 2022.  Most funders have told us they definitely see the need for this program and will consider funding it after they see the complete facility and program plan.  We are confident that our funding asks of $500,000 to $3,000,000 from each respective major funder will raise $10 million.  If we receive the LB1024 funding, the potential to raise funds from private funders will be enhanced.  They will welcome the opportunity to match funds from LB 1024 and to participate in this important, unique opportunity to leverage transformational change for North Omaha.  It is not likely that we will have final funding decisions from those solicited before late-spring 2023.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> If this proposal does not receive significant funds from LB 1024, we would need to make significant reductions to facility design and programming, and take a “bare bones” approach to expanding our footprint and effectiveness in North Omaha.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> We are striving to build a facility that will support expanded “current” programs and the new initiatives that address the longer-term needs referenced herein and by the LB 1024 assessment process.  We believe the scope of this project, with a grant of funds from LB 1024, is “right sized” in its current format, with some room for upward and downward scaling if needed.  It is important that any upward scaling avoid irresponsibly stretching The Salvation Army’s operations revenue needs.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> We have not hired a construction firm and are working with construction estimates provided by knowledgeable advisors that change as the concept evolves.  At the moment, our plan is a unified design with flexible usage for some spaces, so we cannot provide a component breakdown.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> The Salvation Army and its Board leadership are absolutely committed to the proposal and determined to find the necessary funding for the project.  Using local and Territorial capital funds, the Army will invest $2 million in construction and initial program launch.  We are also committed to providing the resources needed on an annual basis for this project to succeed, something an investment from LB 1024 resources will make much easier to achieve.</p>
