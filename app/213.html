  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Pattys Childcare center, we offer professional childcare. With a foundation on bilingual learning our staffs are trained to give a quality education to the kids and parents in our center.
We have two locations one at 1216 Royal Dr Papillion NE 68046 with a capacity of 100 children and we have 10 employees the second location 4102 S 13th st Omaha ne 68107 with a capacity of 99 children and we have 28 employees.
We have been able to see the need that exists in South Omaha for child care, that is why we would like to be able to expand our location, in June 2021 we bought a building in South Omaha located at 5125 s 24th St. We bought this building with the purpose of making it a child care center, due to the high price of construction at this time we have not been able to do so.
At the moment we plan to rent it for an event venue. in which we can raise the cash to be able to build our child care center. we have the plans and the cost of construction.
The construction preliminary plans are designed for 200 children, which will generate 60 jobs in the area. This building has a large parking lot which in the future we would like to build a basketball court to be able to promote the sport among boys and girls in the area this program will generate 13 jobs for after school programs 
The cost of this project is 2 million. the budget that we have was made in the year 2021 for which prices have risen and now we are estimating around 2 million for 2023.</p>
