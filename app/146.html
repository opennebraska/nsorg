  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> The Charles Drew Health Center Executive team has more than twenty-five years of health care experience and leadership serving the North Omaha community, with more than forty-five years of proven leadership experience working with families living in the CDHC target area.  The company has successfully overseen several CDHC capital related projects, including the following:

CDHC has received HRSA, Bureau of Primary Health Care funding since 1983. Its success in providing fiscally sound management of grant funding has been the catalyst behind its success in securing non-HRSA Federal, State and Private investment.  CDHC’s success in completing health centers nearly 27,000 square foot renovation and expansion in 2007 was based in large measure on the health center’s proven ability to provide sound fiscal management of federal and non-federal assets. 

February 2014- CDHC was awarded Affordable Care Act (ACA) Patient Centered Medical Home Facility Improvement (PCMH-FI).  The funding opportunity supported CDHC in expanding its dental service capacity by renovating existing office space into two dental operatories.  The total time between CDHC’s discussions to buildout and project completion was less than 28 months. 
October 2015- Mobile Oral Healthcare Unit equipped with a wheelchair lift, two patient examination rooms, a reception area, and heating and cooling.  Services include oral exam x-rays, cleaning, fluoride varnish, sealants and basic dental hygiene. The total time between CDHC’s discussions to buildout and project completion was less than 9 months. 
March 2019-Charles Drew Health Center at 30 Metro, offers full service medical, dental, and behavioral health care in a 6,000 square foot site located at 5319 N. 30th St.  The property is on the first floor of a residential apartment complex that provides market rate, income restricted, and student housing for the nearby campus of Metropolitan Community College.  Total time from initial project discussions to first date of service was less than 36 months. 
January 2022-CDHC opened its 6,000 square foot Teen & Young Adult Center provides primary medical, reproductive and behavioral health care targeted to the Omaha community ages 15 to 24.  With six medical exam rooms, two behavioral health offices, a mother’s room and classroom space, the health center creates a youth-friendly environment, modeled after proven best practices and staffed with specialized providers. Total time from initial project discussions to first date of service was less than 24 months. 
September 2022- 38 foot Mobile Healthcare Unit provides a full complement of preventive and primary care services including but not limited to: immunizations, chronic illness management, complete physical exams, acute illness, injury care, screening, testing and treatment, health education, referrals to other specialist, substance abuse counseling, risk behavior reduction counseling, nutrition counseling, laboratory test, referral for supportive services linked to the social drivers of health, including health insurance and access to affordable medications. Total time from initial project discussions to first date of service was 32 months.</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Access to coordinated, high quality, integrated health care is the foundation for reducing health disparities and increasing quality of life.  Many health problems that were once untreatable now have better outcomes or are even preventable due to advances in technology and treatment.  To realize the benefits of these advances, patients must not only be able to gain entry to the health care system, but also have access to a location where such services are provided.  Additional barriers among people of color include transportation, knowledge of where to obtain care or when to seek care, cultural barriers, and discrimination. These barriers make it difficult to gain access to even the most basic health services, resulting in disproportionate increases in the incidence of disease, disability, and early death. 

The pressures of the pandemic resulted in healthcare professionals leaving direct patient care roles for more lucrative practices, including travel assignments, or leaving the healthcare profession all together.  The increased turnover rate combined with the already existing clinical staff shortages has created a talent and expertise crisis for community health centers.  It’s reported that by 2025, Nebraska will not have the workforce needed to staff and meet the healthcare care needs of our residents, let alone North Omaha.  Staffing challenges include primary Medical, Dental, Behavioral Health, Pharmacy, Logistics and Operations, HIT, Facilities and Enabling Support.  Providing workforce training opportunities in a structured environment through residency, fellowship, clinical placement, practicums, externship, internship or service learning programming builds a pipeline to career opportunities within the healthcare profession.

CDHC’s service area has a 2019 population of approximately 412,530, with a projected increase of 2.2% by 2025.  It is estimated that the service area had 99,102 unserved lower income residents, equating to a need of 185.6 Provider FTE’s.

Renovation and expansion of the primary service location at 2915 Grant St. 68111 to improve and increase providing direct patient care access, supportive services and workforce opportunities in primary Medical, Dental, Behavioral Health (including substance use disorder services) Pharmacy, Health Center Operations and Enabling Support.  The current facility is approximately 26,900 square feet including direct patient care and administrative space.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Healthcare Transformation: a person centered, integrated, equitable and thorough or dramatic change in the delivery of healthcare at a community level.

Charles Drew Health Center, Inc. (CDHC) is a federally designated “Section 330, Federally Qualified Health Center”, operating 14 locations, including Mobile Dental in Eastern Nebraska. The health center serves the community residents with comprehensive primary medical, dental, behavioral health services and pharmacy, as well as a wide array of community and support services. 

Today, CDHC serves over 14,000 patients each year and is recognized by the Health Resources and Services Administration as a Patient-Centered Medical Home based on their ability to deliver high-quality, cost-effective primary care. Of those patients served, 97% were at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Patients 18 and younger represented nearly 23% of the patient population – many receiving care through their School-based Health Centers. Although 46% of our patients were uninsured, everyone received care regardless of their ability to pay. Through CDHC’s Health Care for the Homeless and Public Housing Primary Care programs, 3,367 patients received medical, dental and behavioral health care in 2020.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Douglas County, has a Physician provider ratio of 576.8 per population of 100,00, a rate 103% higher than the state of Nebraska average which had 283.2 Physician providers per 100,000. Given the urban density of Douglas County in comparison to the state overall it is someone expected to see higher provider ratios but access to services are still needed due to gaps in patient centered, integrated, equitable primary medical care.   At 85.7, Douglas County’s ratio of active Dentists was just 31% higher than the state average, while Mental Health Providers were 52% higher. Based on these figures, further expansion of access to these services are needed.</p>
