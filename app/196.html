  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> JAG Nebraska, in association with United Way of the Midlands, removes barriers and creates paths to transformational opportunity for youth – resulting in improved graduation, employment and educational outcomes for at-risk youth. Through evidence-based curriculum, students learn critical skills for employment and prepare to enter the workforce upon graduation. JAG programming integrates project-based learning, employer engagement, and trauma-informed care through competency-based, for-credit, elective classroom instruction. JAG Nebraska began services in 2019 and currently serves 645 students at 14 middle and high school programs in Nebraska, with plans to expand into at least 12 more in the upcoming 2022-2023 school year. A grant from LE 1024 would accelerate this growth and create positive educational and workforce outcomes for students at five Omaha Public Schools located in Qualified Census Tracts (QCT):  Benson High School, Monroe Middle School, King Science Technical Magnet Middle School, McMillan Middle School, and South High School.</p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> We know that hundreds of students in Omaha face significant barriers to meaningful employment upon graduation. Vulnerable students were impacted earlier and harder by the challenges of the Covid-19 Pandemic. At a time when students are experiencing record learning loss, JAG targets high-need students and helps them build resiliency, overcome obstacles and learn job skills so they can thrive. We’ve seen JAG change lives, and disrupt cycles of multi-generational poverty.  JAG programming integrates project-based learning, employer engagement, and trauma-informed care through competency-based, for-credit, elective classroom instruction. Through the program, students engage in hands-on, realistic learning experiences. As a result of the JAG program, students identified to participate are less likely to be truant and less likely to engage in incidents of violence. JAG is a state-based program that empowers students to succeed in classroom, career and life. JAG puts students at the center of a three-tiered strategy including project-based learning, employer engagement, and trauma informed care. Each strategy is implemented using evidence-based practices. For instance, JAG follows the Buck Institute for Education PBL model, a nationally recognized practice. JAG’s project-based learning continuum is proven to be an effective model in building relationships between the student participants and employers within their respective communities.  The model also consists of a comprehensive set of services designed to keep young people in school, while decreasing truancy and incidents of violence. These outcomes ensure that students are on the path to success and financial stability. 
Past successes include: JAG students achieved 100% graduation/HS equivalency, 77% secured Military employment, and 79% secured full time (30 hours/week) employment. As a result of the JAG program, students identified to participate will have increased attendance rates, increased academic performance, increased high school graduation rates with successful transition into full-time employment. JAG students throughout Nebraska are projected to produce over $5,000,000 in increased spending annually. JAG graduates are projected to increase state and local tax revenue by over $200,000 by the midpoint of their careers. JAG Nebraska equips students in Omaha for meaningful employment through on-site and hands-on instruction during school hours, decreases truancy, and decreases incidents of school violence, thus creating a more sustainable community. A trained Career Specialist in each school functions as a teacher, coach, mentor and advocate for students with identified barriers to success. JAG is offered as an elective class during the regular school day, motivating students to come to school and helping them thrive once they get there. Throughout the duration of the program, students build relationships with local employers and work collaboratively with other organizations through volunteer efforts in service learning and employer engagement. Middle school students in the JAG program are truant less often and have fewer incidents of violence.  A grant from LE 1024 would support programing for five Omaha Public Schools located within Qualified Census Tracts, increasing attendance, academic performance, and high school graduation rates with successful transition into full-time employment and/or post-secondary education or training programs. Students engage in hands-on, realistic learning experiences, mastering a minimum of up to 87 competencies translatable to workforce. JAG Nebraska Career Specialists are teachers, mentors, and advocates who provide individual attention and support to students in navigating high school education and employment attainment or post-secondary education following high school graduation, assisting students in overcoming barriers to success.

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> The JAG NE program creates a more sustainable community through increased graduation rates and employment training which leads to meaningful careers for individuals in vulnerable areas of Omaha.  The JAG model has proven to foster positive educational and financial outcomes for high-need students. Graduates of the JAG NE program are more likely to transition into full employment (77% secured Military employment, and 79% secured full time employment), thus creating a boon for the economy of these communities, and the city overall.  Racial and ethnic minorities represent 61.36 % of JAG NE students, these students benefit from assistance they would otherwise not have, increasing their economic contribution to a diverse community. JAG Nebraska also provides leadership development experiences through extracurricular JAG Career Association chapters which includes student-led planning and engagement for public service, career exploration and preparation, and social awareness projects and activities. Students who are involved in extracurricular activities are more likely to graduate and work successfully together through demonstrated teamwork and collaborative skills. As a result, JAG Nebraska students are well-equipped to contribute to the local community through attainment of meaningful employment and active civic engagement for overall greater outcomes. Again and again, we’ve seen that JAG has the power to change student trajectories and accelerate positive outcomes.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> A strong partnership with the Nebraska Department of Labor and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services provides a strong foundation of support for JAG Nebraska. TANF dollars require the majority of JAG Nebraska student enrollments to qualify for the free- or reduced-lunch program. While this partnership is vital to JAG Nebraska, United Way of the Midlands continues to increase partnerships and multiple funding streams to diversifying funding for sustainable longevity of JAG programming. As we continue partnering with Nebraska Department of Labor, which includes Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) federal funds, we also foster a strong commitment with each school district who also contribute a portion of the funding empowering long-term sustainability for programs within each school. Additionally, JAG Nebraska through United Way of the Midlands, has increased philanthropic support and employer engagement by way of the United Way corporate campaign that allows donors to designate dollars toward the local support of JAG Nebraska. United Way Emerging Leaders, our local and dynamic young professionals’ group, selected to support JAG Nebraska for fundraising initiatives to support our local community in a meaningful way</p>
