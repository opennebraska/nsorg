-	Jobs – Creation of both temporary and permanent livable waged jobs in construction, property management, food service, and hospitality</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>

-	Long-Lasting Growth – Creation of both temporary and permanent livable waged job opportunities with increase economic vitality of North Omaha while also keeping dollars in our community longer</p>

-	Quality of life amenities that are non-existent to current market in the form of “Bar + Coffee”, our breakfast restaurant that will be opened in space.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> The mixed-use development approach taken for the Greenwood Building is a proven concept that incorporates Live/Work/Play elements in a single location. This creates an environment with the best ability to organically grow and expand outward as it incorporates all aspects of daily life.

  <p> As new developers, the only resources that we had available to us was our time and willingness to learn/dig in to the process.

This project will serve as a catalyst for future projects and demonstrate to other lay-persons, like us, that incredible things can happen within our community when ideas are activated and people work collectively.</p>
