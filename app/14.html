  <h3>OtherCompletedProjects</h3>
  <p> HFHO has been building and renovating homes in Omaha since 1984. Over the years, the organization has grown to serve five counties, and HFHO's holistic approach to neighborhood revitalization has led to the addition of home repair and weatherization programs that have helped the organization serve more than 2,000 households over its 38-year history. HFHO has built 466 affordable new construction houses, rehabilitated 201 existing houses in North and South Omaha, and has completed more than 450 home repairs for Douglas County homeowners. Between 2014 and 2020, HFHO invested more than $8 million in the Kountze Park neighborhood, transforming the areas surrounding King Science Magnet school with 57 new construction homes, 17 gut rehabs, 40 demolitions of blighted and condemned homes, and 21 home improvement projects for area homeowners. This broad-scale neighborhood redevelopment project was the next step in HFHO's strategic goal to increase homeownership, serve more families, and provide innovative housing solutions. HFHO's success in Kountze Park led it to look for other opportunities to revitalize North Omaha's historic neighborhoods and brought its focus to the rundown property that was once the Wintergreen Apartments. HFHO feels it is well prepared to give new life to this area through its Bluestem I development and to introduce another vibrant neighborhood to the former Scatterjoy Acres property.</p>

  <h3>TotalBudget</h3>
  <p> 74388046.0</p>

  <h3>LB1024GrantFundingRequest</h3>
  <p> 20000000.0</p>

  <h3>ProposalType</h3>
  <p> Capital project</p>

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> HFHO is requesting $20m in LB1024 support for its two Bluestem developments in North Omaha. Of the $20m, $12m would be used for site preparation, utilities, and infrastructure for both Bluestem I and II. $1.6m will be used to purchase land, which will become Bluestem II. HFHO has an executed purchase agreement for this property. The remaining $6m would fund 22 affordable housing units in Bluestem I.

Bluestem I will be a mixed-income development located at 50th and Redick, with 85 units, including 20 2-bedroom empty-nester villas and 65 single-family homes. The single-family homes will be 3-5 bedrooms, dependent on family size, with some accessory dwelling units to allow multiple generations to cohabitate. Initial tree removal and demolition have already been completed, and HFHO will move forward with site preparation, infrastructure, and utilities in Fall 2022. Basement excavation for the homes will begin in 2022, with construction kicking off in early 2023. As part of this project, HFHO is renovating and expanding the adjacent Myott Park, installing a multi-use community park, including recreational fields, playground equipment, sports courts, and paved walking trails through the new greenspace that will connect to nearby neighborhoods. Bluestem I, with the park and 85 homes, will be complete by the end of 2024.
Bluestem II will follow on the heels of Bluestem I, allowing HFHO to transform a large swath of undeveloped land southwest of Forest Lawn, just north of Newport Ave, formerly known as Scatterjoy Acres. HFHO will begin site and infrastructure work on Bluestem II in 2023, utilizing the proximity of its crews to work simultaneously on both projects. This blank slate will require significant utility and infrastructure work as well as street installation. Site preparation and infrastructure will complete by the end of 2024, with only a small amount of utility and paving to be completed in early 2025. 120 new single-family units will be constructed as part of Bluestem II, with the development projecting to complete by the end of 2026. Funds granted through LB1024 will be obligated by 12/31/2024 with most, if not all, funds spent prior to that date.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> This project is shovel-ready, with Bluestem I moving ahead with infrastructure and utility work this fall. HFHO will break ground on the new houses in October of 2022 with basement excavations and foundations, and construction of the units will begin in early 2023. HFHO will complete 37 units in Bluestem I by the end of 2023, and the remaining 48 units will be completed in 2024. Homes will be sold to families once completed, with some houses adjacent to very active work areas being held until the development is complete before being sold. Bluestem II will begin in 2023, with site development, infrastructure, and 15 housing units completed by the end of that year. An additional 90 homes will be constructed in Bluestem II in 2025, and 15 in 2026, to bring Bluestem II’s final constructed units to 120. In total, the two developments will contain 205 new affordable housing units. Like Bluestem I, Bluestem II houses will be sold to families as sections of the development complete, with all homes sold in Bluestem II by the end of 2027.

  <h3>OtherExplanation</h3>
  <p> </p>

  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> Housing remains one of the biggest needs in Omaha in order to address the estimated current 98,500 gap in affordable housing. An immediate investment in affordable housing is needed to address this growing gap and to bring transformational change to the community by building generational wealth through homeownership. 
HFHO is requesting $20m in funding from the LB1024 to support infrastructure and site development of its Bluestem I & II developments, including land acquisition for Bluestem II, and 22 single-family homes in Bluestem I. HFHO will match these funds with $13.2 million in secured funding for the project, providing a shovel-ready project to maximize LB1024’s immediate impact in the community.
The proposed project is part of HFHO’s redevelopment of 18.5 acres of land at 51st and Reddick Plz. that lie within a QCT and are designated as Extremely Blighted. The former site of the Wintergreen Apartments, this land has been sitting unused since 2006 when the troubled apartment complex was demolished. In 2021 HFHO acquired the property from the City of Omaha and renamed the area "Bluestem Prairie." Working with civil engineering firm Lamp Rynearson, HFHO began creating plans for an innovative, forward-thinking new development project. In 2022 HFHO officially broke ground on its Bluestem Prairie, or Bluestem I project, with plans to complete the construction of 85 affordable housing units by 2024. Bluestem I will include empty-nester villas with zero-entry accessibility options, single-family homes that can be finished with 3-5 bdrms. to accommodate larger families, and houses with ADUs to allow multigenerational families to live together comfortably. Bluestem I will be bolstered by the renovation of 20 additional properties in surrounding neighborhoods, providing more than 100 affordable housing units in North O within the next two years. As families begin to move into Bluestem I, HFHO will shift its development to Bluestem II. Lying on the north and northeast boundaries of Bluestem I, the 27-acre former Scatterjoy Acres property just south of Forest Lawn will become Bluestem II, where an additional 120 affordable housing units will be built by the end of 2026.
Over its 38 years working in Omaha, HFHO has developed a holistic approach to neighborhood revitalization—seeking to create a safe, healthy environment that encourages community-building and equal access for individuals of all abilities. As part of this, HFHO will also be renovating Myott Park, adjacent to the new Bluestem development. Myott Park will be transformed into a greenspace with sports courts, ball fields, accessible playgrounds, and picnic shelters to encourage residents of all ages and abilities to enjoy the outdoors. Walking and bike trails will connect Bluestem to surrounding schools and neighborhoods, helping to integrate the new developments into the community. 
Bluestem I and Bluestem II will require substantial site preparation, utility, and infrastructure work. Bluestem II's 27 acres have been operated as an animal rehabilitation center since 2006, and HFHO will be making a significant investment in power, water, and sewer tie-ins, as well as road installation. A construction bid package has been developed for Bluestem I, and HFHO will be preparing a construction bid package for Bluestem II in early 2023. The budget for Bluestem II was developed based on the Bluestem I budget, with consideration given to material and labor cost increases and the site's increased requirement for utilities expansion and paving. A public competitive bid process was completed prior to awarding the current contracts. HFHO will adhere to all federal bidding and contracting requirements as part of this project. Once complete, these two developments will create a vibrant, sustainable community in North O that supports a healthy quality of life through greenspace and spurs economic investment with the introduction of 205 invested new homeowners over the next 5 yrs.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> HFHO's Bluestem development project leans on the strengths and opportunities within North Omaha that were identified as part of the visioning workshop while, at the same time, addressing and offering solutions to many of the threats to its future growth. The visioning workshop identified a lack of quality, entry-level homes within North O and a high ratio of renter-households compared to owner-occupied households, which was seen as a threat to the community's economic stability. There was an additional concern for the high debt levels of many area renters, preventing them from becoming more permanent homeowners. HFHO's Almost Home program works with families to set budgets, pay down debt, and become mortgage-ready. Since the program's launch earlier this year, it has seen an overwhelming response, with more than 3,000 phone calls received in the first day. This housing counseling and mortgage-readiness program creates a pipeline of prepared homebuyers that will feed into the Bluestem I and II developments as they complete. Two hundred and five new homes will welcome families into the community, where they will grow roots, pay their property taxes, and feed economic growth for the area's small businesses.
HFHO has long seen one of the strengths identified during the visioning sessions—a strong, multigenerational community—as one of the defining characteristics of North O and one of the keys to maintaining the culture and stability of the area. The visioning workshops recognized the threat to that multigenerational foundation as older residents struggled to age in place in the area's predominately two-story homes. The Bluestem developments were designed with this in mind, including both empty-nester villas and homes with Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU) to accommodate older North O residents who need easily accessible, smaller homes as they retire or those who want to live with their children as they age. 
The visioning workshops also recognized that residents of North Omaha were more likely to suffer from poor health and obesity. HFHO is incorporating the complete revitalization of an old city park adjacent to the Bluestem developments to create a healthy and welcoming greenspace that is accessible to all ages and abilities. The park will feature walking trails, gathering spaces, a playground, sports courts, and recreational fields to get residents out of their homes and connecting with their community.
Bluestem represents what HFHO sees as the future of North Omaha—a vibrant, multigenerational community with innovative planning that will lead to an economic corridor as development pushes further east toward North 30th St. This is an investment in fundamental change that will transform 41 acres of land into a thriving community that will enable workforce housing stability and economic growth for the area.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> This request aligns with the E3 Expenditure Category of the North Omaha Recovery Plan and Section 4.2 of LB1024’s grant priorities with single-family housing unit development and the support of health through outdoor spaces through the building of 205 new single-family units and the revitalization and expansion of a city park and trail system. This project represents fundamental change and spurs economic development.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> One of HFHO's strategic priorities is increasing its use of minority-owned businesses in building its homes. As part of its development of Bluestem I & II, HFHO is committed to using minority contractors whenever possible and to sourcing its building materials and lumber from local North Omaha suppliers. HFHO uses subcontractors for work such as excavation, roofing, and electrical work. This will create work for area contractors and increase their need for labor from the community. HFHO is committed to fair labor wages for all its staff and subcontractors.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactPermanentJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> As HFHO works to complete the two developments, it is also scaling up its program staff to meet the increased demand for the homes and its housing counseling program. Twelve new jobs are expected to be added across the organization as we ramp up our building over the next five years.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactTemporaryJobsCreated</h3>
  <p> Increased demand for subcontractor labor in completing the infrastructure and utility work on the two sites, building 205 new housing units, the park renovation, and trail installation will generate a significant number of subcontractor construction jobs for the area.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactWageLevels</h3>
  <p> HFHO hires employees based on wage studies of similar positions within the job market. Wage levels depend upon the requirements of the position and the applicant's skills and experience. Subcontractor labor wages are set by the individual businesses HFHO partners with to build its homes.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpactAlignProposedJobs</h3>
  <p> HFHO intends to prioritize hiring subcontractors and sourcing materials and lumber from businesses in Qualified Census Tracts. Currently, 15% of HFHO’s subcontractors are minority-owned businesses, and we are working hard to increase that percentage. The shovel-ready nature of this project uniquely positions it to provide immediate and ongoing job opportunities for North and South Omaha businesses and contractors.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefit</h3>
  <p> An investment in housing is an investment in the long-term growth of a community. As Bluestem I and II complete, 205 families will move in and begin investing their time and money in their new community. HFHO has seen over and over how an influx of new, committed homeowners into a neighborhood spurs the creation or growth of neighborhood associations that protect the integrity of the community. These families, having proactively worked to become mortgage-ready, are ready to put down roots, commit to jobs in the area, pay property taxes, and spend their money at area businesses. Homeownership not only builds the generational wealth that lifts up a community, but it gives housing cost-burden families the room to breathe and the financial bandwidth to eat at local restaurants and shop at neighborhood stores. 
With the completion of the two Bluestem developments, the community will have the added health benefits reaped from open greenspace and walking paths, the gift of invested neighbors ready to grow and better North Omaha, and the transformation of overgrown land into a beautiful and innovative new neighborhood. Long-term, these developments will help keep families rooted in North Omaha where they will contribute to a stable workforce, and we will be one step closer to closing the affordable housing gap.</p>

  <h3>CommunityBenefitSustainability</h3>
  <p> Myott Park currently sits adjacent to Bluestem I and is an overgrown and rundown eyesore. HFHO will completely revitalize and expand this park to create a tiered, visually open greenspace with gathering areas, sports courts, recreational fields, playgrounds, wetland improvements, and walking trails. The park will be accessible, with paved walking trails to make it easier for older residents to get out and walk without fear of falling, and a playground that will be welcoming to all. This project will not only improve the natural landscape of the area, but it will enhance the quality of life for area residents who can enjoy the outdoors and opportunities for physical activities created through the park investment.</p>

  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> In working with Lamp Rynearson in planning Bluestem, HFHO was intent on thinking outside the box in designing a development that embraced innovation and addressed the needs of the community in a way that wasn't currently being done in North Omaha. The Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU) and empty-nester villas incorporated into the plan were born out of a conversation with an invested Kountze park neighbor, Ms. Edwina, who lamented the inability of long-time North O residents to age-in-place because the older homes in North Omaha are typically two-stories. She suggested we invest in ways for empty-nesters to sell their current homes to young families and move into downsized, accessible houses. As we worked with more and more families, we also saw parents and grandparents living in multigenerational households with their children and grandchildren. There are very few affordable, comfortably-sized housing options for these families, and most are forced to live in overcrowded conditions. HFHO took these ideas and went back to the community, inviting focus groups to comment on the need for such units and what they would like to see incorporated in the design. There was an overwhelmingly positive response to the idea of both the ADUs and the empty-nester villas and the size and features of the Bluestem home designs reflect the input of these focus groups. Financial, homebuyer, and home upkeep and maintenance education are part of the Habitat pathway to homeownership, with families purchasing the homes through a 30-year affordable mortgage with Habitat as the mortgage lender. This unique model creates long-term, successful homeowners who are invested and active participants in their community.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> Homeownership has been proven to improve health and educational outcomes for children. Renters experience frequent moves that directly impact learning and educational progression, and many renters are forced to live in substandard conditions. HFHO has seen the reality of this as it has tracked the success of its program through the years. A survey of current Habitat Homeowners performed by HFHO in 2016 found that becoming homeowners had substantially improved the quality of life for partnering low-income families. These improvements included better health and educational outcomes for their children, a greater sense of safety, and a high number of respondents who felt that homeownership made them more optimistic about their financial future and the future welfare of their children. The 205 families who will live in the Bluestem developments will benefit similarly, with increased economic and educational stability, as well as asset creation that will allow them to build generational wealth.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> HFHO tracks these and other outcomes of its homeowners, including reductions in housing expenses, credit score impacts, and the long-term health and welfare of its homebuyers. A dedicated HFHO staffer communicates with Habitat mortgage-holders, checking on their welfare and gathering data and information to track program successes and outcomes.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementCoinvestment</h3>
  <p> Yes, an investment in Bluestem acts as a catalyst for further economic investment in this area. With an additional 205 households to serve, this will help draw businesses to the area. Our hope is that this will be the beginning of what will one day become an economic corridor, spawning further investment in North Omaha. HFHO will also conduct outreach to nearby neighborhoods via mailings to promote its no-interest home repair loans, causing the investment made in Bluestem to have a ripple effect on the surrounding areas as homeowners invest in repairing their homes.</p>

  <h3>Partnerships</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>PartnershipsOrgs</h3>
  <p> It was important to HFHO that the community have an opportunity to offer input and feedback on the Bluestem project and we consulted with a large number of community partners, the City of Omaha, design and engineering firms, state senators, local legislators, and our Board of Directors and Advisory Board in preparing the plans and timeline for Bluestem. Throughout 2021 we met with members of the community, including neighbors and local businesses, in a series of meetings and focus groups to gather feedback. HFHO has a strong partnership with the North Omaha Neighborhood Association and met with that group, in particular, to update them on our plans and answer any questions they might have about the impact of the construction and the scope of the project. Lamp Rynearson completed designs, budget estimates, and contract bidding packages for Bluestem. HFHO also intends to use local, North O contractors and suppliers whenever possible in completing the Bluestem project.</p>

  <h3>RequestRationale</h3>
  <p> A project budget for both phases of the Bluestem development, as well as a Development ProForma, have been uploaded as Attachments D and E, respectively. Budgeted costs were based on estimates from Lamp Rynearson and adjusted as necessary after initial construction bidding began for Bluestem I. HFHO strives to be good stewards of our donors' funds and works to keep costs at a minimum while ensuring that we are building safe, energy-efficient, visually appealing, quality homes.</p>

  <h3>GrantFundsUsage</h3>
  <p> Funds will be used for site development, infrastructure, and utilities for both Bluestem I & II, land acquisition for Bluestem II, park improvements, and 22 new construction, single-family units in Bluestem I.</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainability</h3>
  <p> Yes</p>

  <h3>ProposalFinancialSustainabilityOperations</h3>
  <p> The fiscal operations of this project will be overseen by Louis Olivera, HFHO's CFO, who will ensure HFHO's finance team properly tracks program income and adheres to all funding requirements. CEO Amanda Brewer conducts regular check-ins with senior leadership to ensure the project remains within budget and meets all set milestone goals. HFHO's board of directors receives quarterly reports on the project's progress, and the board's Finance Committee provides financial advisement. John Haske, HFHO's Director of Development, tracks fundraising requirements and develops and leads the Development team in meeting the project's fund needs. Janneane Gerot, Senior Project Manager, will submit all reimbursement requests under the LB1024 grants and ensure financial documentation of expenses is maintained for the required retention period.</p>

  <h3>FundingSources</h3>
  <p> HFHO has secured $13.2 million in funding for Bluestem and is beginning asks for Bluestem II. The commitments come from major donors, foundation and government grants, and from a TIF agreement with the City of Omaha. HFHO is aware of the DED’s desire that NAHTF funds not comingle with ARPA funding and has designated those funds to houses not included in the LB1024 funding requests. Details of this funding can be found in Attachment E.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesPendingDecisions</h3>
  <p> HFHO did submit a Community Project proposal to Senator Don Bacon for the Myott Park revitalization and hopes to hear if this was awarded in early 2023. As this is not guaranteed, we have included $240,000 in park funding with this proposal. If the Community Project proposal is funded, there are approximately $700,000 in additional infrastructure costs for Bluestem II that could be covered with the LB1024 funds and which would be easily committed to by December 2024 and completed by July 2025. Details of our pending asks can be found in Attachment E.</p>

  <h3>FundingSourcesCannotContinue</h3>
  <p> HFHO is determined to make Bluestem I and II a reality, but without funding from LB1024, we will have to push off Bluestem II to allow for substantial fundraising.</p>

  <h3>Scalability</h3>
  <p> The project can be scaled down to only complete Bluestem I; however, HFHO feels this would substantially decrease the transformative effect of a combined investment in both developments.</p>

  <h3>ScalabilityComponents</h3>
  <p> If needed, this could be broken down to include only the funds for Bluestem I and the land purchase of Bluestem II. This would reduce the impact of the investment, bringing the total house count from 205 down to 85.</p>

  <h3>FinancialCommitment</h3>
  <p> HFHO is financially committed to completing Bluestem I by the end of 2024 and Bluestem II by the end of 2026 with the requested funding from LB1024. HFHO’s Development department is prepared to pursue funding commitments to cover the remaining balance of Bluestem II to ensure it meets all of its obligations. This is supported by HFHO’s long history of reliable performance and speedy drawdowns of its government grants.</p>
