  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> Our proposal is to create sustainable safe affordable middle- and low-income housing in the Sherwoods and Pruyn’s Subdivision. The development project will align with existing homes and multifamily units in the area connecting already established multi-unit communities Shannon Height Senior Town Homes, Habitat for Humanity Single family homes, and Holly Name single family homes that are currently under construction.

There is a growing need for safe affordable housing in the designated development area. Our development is in an Extremely Blighted Community Redevelopment Area, which will greatly improve the designation status. The development will utilize Section 3 contractors and create over 50 construction positions ranging from laborers to superintendents. The new housing development will bring displaced middle- and low-income home buyers and renters back to the community, development will consist of three (2bedroom, 1.5bath) duplexes, two (2bedroom, 2bath) duplexes, and three (3bedroom, 2.5bath) triplexes for a total of 19 single family residences. Each unit will be available for sale as town homes or for rent. This development will also improve green space areas by way of shared courtyard, and small garden area across the street revamping another empty lot.

The development will be in the QCTs outlined by LB1024 and is projected to be completed within the outlined timeframe. Adherence to all federal, state and city regulations and process can be met and have been considered. The likelihood of success is 100% probable with requested funding.

The development will create at minimum 50 temporary trades jobs with wages ranging from $19 to $29 dollars an hour. The overall economic impact of this development will be beautification of the area by revitalizing an area that is currently a known eyesores due to constant dumping of garbage, furniture, and abandoned cars this site is typically overgrown and unkept. This project will create a flourishing landscape free of debris. 

The recent Public Engagement Survey for the North Omaha Community identified Housing as a need that must happen to see real transformational change and long-term economic success. 

The Survey identifies “Uses” Sustainable Community at 40%, this proposal aligns with what the community wants and needs.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> The timeline for the development for the buildings to be in service is 2years; this estimate is considering potential delays due to weather or material procurement issues; the estimated completion date is April 2025. However, the development schedule proposed is laid out as follows: land acquisition has started, with an estimated 6-7months time frame for land to be purchased from the city; mid-April 2023. We will then start the land development phase which will take approximately 3months; July 2023. Site work will begin, and foundation will be poured July 2023 as well. Building construction will commence in August and continue for at least 9months; mid-May 2024. All final work trim, appliance and fixtures and landscaping are estimated to be complete by September 2024.</p>
