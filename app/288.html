Revive also created the Revive!

  <h3>BriefProposalSummary</h3>
  <p> The Center for Collaboration, Culture and Communication is an innovative space for a local cultural organization, internationally known film company and several national consulting firms.  The vision is a condo version of ownership where each floor is owned by a different business.  

There is interest by a local organization for the bottom floor which will potentially need 10,000 square feet.  The cultural organization would host exhibits and events and own the bottom floor of the building.  

Office space on the second floor has generated interest from BCT Partners led by Dr Randall Pinkett, Night Fox Entertainment’s CEO Tim Christian and Torch Enterprises CEO Dr. Pamela Jolly to potentially locate together in a common building.  All of these firms do business on a local, national and international level.  
Night Fox Entertainment has a need for 5,000 square feet of space.  The remaining sq footage on the second floor will be utilized by the other companies and also include meeting space and executive board rooms.  

BCT partners has expressed interest in exploring an Omaha office.  BCT currently has three consultants working in Omaha from home offices.  Dr. Pinkett is strongly interested in expanding business relationships in Omaha and throughout the Midwest and Western regions.  An office space in the heart of the country where BCT has invested seven years building relationships is a great fit.  

Dr. Pamela Jolly has worked in Omaha for over seven years in partnership with the Empowerment Network.  Her company, Torch Enterprises, has a growing footprint and client base in Omaha and she consistently brings other national consultants and clients to the city.  Dr. Jolly has expressed interest in office space in Omaha to support the work and partnerships which are expanding.

The third floor of the building would house mixed-income apartments.

Phase II of this project is the development of a movie theater, conference center and small cultural boutique hotel. A preliminary vision for the theater complex and meeting facility has been developed.  We anticipate a community investment model which could include graduates of the Legacy Wealth Initiative and others.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p> Center for Collaboration, Culture and Communications
The formal proposal is in development.  However, the potential tenants have expressed strong interest and are looking forward to coming together within the next 30 days to finalize a plan.  Once the team is able to confirm the space needs and potential rental agreements from each tenant, a more formalized plan can be submitted.

The team does not own the proposed site.  Meetings will be held with the landowners.  

With approval of the landowners and the confirmation of the tenants, discussions will move forward with the landowners.  We anticipate a favorable response pending the development of joint parking solutions for both buildings.

If for some reason the location doesn't work, the developers and tenants are open to building a new facility in the 24th and Lake area on a different site.

The Ritz Theater, Conference Center and Hotel:
The team does not own the land.  The team will work with OEDC to determine the feasibility of purchasing the land or partnering on the project.

SMB and Night Fox will discuss with OPS the potential use of land for additional parking.

The team will meet with neighbors and stakeholders regarding the project.

Once these meetings have occurred, the team will formalize the fund development plan and gain commitments from tenants and users.</p>

BCT partners has expressed interest in exploring an Omaha office.  BCT currently has three consultants working in Omaha from home offices.  Dr. Pinkett is strongly interested in expanding business relationships in Omaha and throughout the Midwest and Western regions.

Her company, Torch Enterprises, has a growing footprint and client base in Omaha and she consistently brings other national consultants and clients to the city.  Dr. Jolly has expressed interest in office space in Omaha to support the work and partnerships which are expanding.

An additional potential tenant collaborates nationally with clients that will also travel to Omaha periodically and will need a hotel or apartment to utilize.  

The third floor of the building would house mixed-income apartments.


Phase II:  Ritz Theater, Conference Center and Hotel
Phase II of this project to bring film and collaborative events to North Omaha is the development of a movie theater, conference center and small cultural boutique hotel. A preliminary vision for the theater complex and meeting facility has been developed.  The team anticipate a community investment model which could include graduates of the Legacy Wealth Initiative and others.

The theater space would be a multi-use space for banquets, movies and other meetings and special occasions.  

The conference center would allow North Omaha to keep money in the neighborhood by providing organizations, businesses, churches and other an option to hold their meetings, conferences and summits at 24th and Lake.

The small, cultural boutique hotel would allow speakers, visitors, tourists and special guests the opportunity to stay in the historic district along 24th and Street.  

The plan is to build the facility on the former home of the historic Ritz Theater.  The property is owned by OEDC.  If this site doesn’t work, the theater, conference center and hotel complex could be located elsewhere in the district.</p>
