  <h3>ProposalDescriptionAndNeedsAlignment</h3>
  <p> SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY & ALIGNMENT

In 2020, the University of Nebraska system launched 5 Year Strategic Plan emphasizing multiple initiatives related to iEXCEL offerings, which included fostering talent development and institutional partnerships. Talent Development goals included providing each student with experiential learning opportunities through partnerships. Furthermore, micro-credentials and non-credit coursework are emphasized as a new strategy within this initiative.

iEXCEL leadership was selected to contribute to the NU Digital Education Task Force throughout 2022 to help formulate the strategic plan for NU digital education for 2027-2032. The outcomes of this task force also emphasized badging programs, micro-credentials, experiential learning opportunities and cross-campus curriculum that would further facilitate application of the iEXCEL model across the entire NU system and beyond.

Leveraging the unique technologies of the Davis Global Center, the iEXCEL model for experiential learning and simulation-based training, and the unique capabilities of a world-class staff should be disseminated to create a prosperous and sustainable STEM workforce in targeted areas of Nebraska.

IMPACT ON HEALTH AND WELLNESS
iEXCEL proposes to provide training in advanced digital and technology skill sets for those who live in the North and South Omaha communities so they can partner with iEXCEL to create relevant health and wellness adaptive learning modules that can be delivered through advanced technologies. These visual and interactive modules will be used to inform the community about health and wellness, as well as any actions that can be taken related to healthy living options and utilizing primary healthcare services.

OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE

There is a well – documented shortage of a workforce that can manage 5G networks, bandwidth, and especially a workforce with the skills necessary to keep the internet secure and operational. The installation of a secure 5G system within the North and South Omaha communities will ensure tremendous bandwidth at selected sites to increase wireless bandwidth for the development and viewing of health - related modules. The availability of the next generation of 5G resources will provide high speed, cutting–edge connectivity placing the communities at an advantage for health - related education, specialized training, entrepreneurship and, tele-health capabilities. A secure 5G hub is essential for example, to transport medical images across distance. The economic and psychological impact on a community with an aligned vision to create a digitally competent city is immeasurable - especially if a trained work force is focused in distressed communities who are already feeling left out of the present and, by default – the future.

Creating and disseminating data and healthcare information requires specialized “hands-on” training, as does creating the 3D content and images for the fast - growing digital worlds – including the rapidly emerging Metaverse. IEXCEL and business partners will provide specialized training in workforce skills in this new and emerging technology. These capabilities can be realized through the proposed iEXCEL Digital Equity Program.

QUALITY OF LIFE

The iEXCEL Digital Equity Program will also help meet community needs by embedding overall wellness throughout the training programs. Healthy lifestyles are a critical factor in reducing risk factors such as weight, blood pressure and cholesterol. Engaging and stimulating interest in middle school and high school students and young adults, to promote healthy living at an early age, will encourage wellness habits that propel them into positive sustainable routines. As with food, shelter, clothing, and health, that are basic human needs, having a fast and efficient internet network that can propel images and data across distance at high speed, is also becoming an essential ingredient for the success of individuals and communities.</p>

  <h3>VisioningWorkshopFindingsAlignment</h3>
  <p> The proposed program helps to address the identified concerns and needs of the Visioning Workshop document. These Include:

Medical Training and Education (Areas of program focus include Fundamental education to promote wellness, mental, physical and exploration of telehealth)

Marketing, Community and Youth Employment Program (Step Up Omaha!)  (Empowering communities through integration of Technology assets within the Davis Global Center to help promote and raise awareness and promote a K-12 pipeline)

HUB Resource 5G Integration at select sites in the communities will allow for distribution of Program Content from UNMC to established IHUBS and/or schools. The iEXCEL 5G hub will provide the ability to transport images across distance as well as provide training onsite at Davis Global Center for support at the iHubs and selected sites.

North and South Omaha Permanent Staffing - Establish a train the trainer program working through the iEXCEL team to build a sustainable and independent workforce within the communities identified. The goal is to work with the community towards establishing self-sufficiency in managing their own 5G network, train others, and stimulate entrepreneurial activities, as well as attract existing businesses.</p>

  <h3>PrioritiesAlignment</h3>
  <p> The UNMC iEXCEL team has thoroughly reviewed Legislative Bill (LB 1024) as well as the Public Engagement Summary to ensure true alignment between the UNMC iEXCEL Digital Equity Program proposal and the select requirements outlined within the bill. The project framework mentioned within the policy section above, proposes a system to measure the efforts aligned with the findings of the Visioning Workshop focused on: Building on existing strengths, mitigating identified weaknesses, and leveraging opportunities.</p>

  <h3>EconomicImpact</h3>
  <p> IEXCEL is already a major success story in Nebraska. Since opening in March 2020, more than 85,000 learners and visitors have engaged with the iEXCEL program. The total economic impact of iEXCEL on the Nebraska economy from operations, visitors and business mission impact has already grown by 61% in the past two years from $13.3 million in 2020 to $22.4 million in FY22.

Extending the successful iEXCEL model into North and South Omaha will allow for rapid workforce development which will increase the creation of higher paying jobs.  An economic impact was produced by Tripp Umbach and estimates are conservative as they are based on experience with commercialization of research at other academic medical centers.  However, with advancements being made in technology and innovation at iEXCEL, industry, military and government partnerships are projected to accelerate over the next decade.
