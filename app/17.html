  <h3>BestPracticesInnovation</h3>
  <p> My duties are teaching the foundation core of the business and the mindset of a  business owner. What to look for; the knowledge and understanding of your skill set and to identify the main areas of the business and master those areas—teaching keywords in business on a world audience scale and key branding points to your target audience. Also, set a layout for your business needs and plans before you approach the financial need analysis. What would you need to cultivate that brand and business to meet your goal and succeed? Well, it help to bring new concepts to Omaha's young and future leaders.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurement</h3>
  <p> The outcome is to test the areas and provide them with the knowledge, tools, and support for financial literacy. The community will have the opportunity to build an excellent credit score, manage finances, and provide legal documents for business,  family, and personal use. That also allows us to create, strategize, and cultivate a culture leading to financial freedom through education and publication.</p>

  <h3>OutcomeMeasurementHow</h3>
  <p> As a outcome our students will be tested in the area we taught, to get them to see their strengths and weakness; the test will expose the knowledge they have learned and what they need to work on as they move forward and this will all give the instructor information if that student may need additional help after the class or one on one time is need. This also gives us the opportunity to build that student interest in business and start cultivating a logo and brand for the future legally.</p>
