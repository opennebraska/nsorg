Dear Ryan ZimmerMas,

Under the Nebraska Public Records Law ยง 84-712 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that (1) list the 369 grant applications submitted for consideration of LB1024 funding as analyzed by Canyon Research Southwest, Inc. and submitted to Michael C. Piernicky of Olsson, Inc. on October 28, 2022. This data is published as a PDF "appendix_f.pdf" here:

  https://nebraskalegislature.gov/pdf/reports/committee/select_special/econrec/appendix_f.pdf

I am requesting the tabular portions of that PDF in spreadsheet, CSV, or database format.

(2) Further, 130 of those proposed grants have been funded, as published here:

  https://opportunity.nebraska.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/North-and-South-Omaha-Recovery-Grant-Program_Recipients.pdf

That PDF is lacking the Application Number of each grant request. I am requesting a spreadsheet, CSV, or database formatted file of those public records including the precise Application Number of each of those grant recipients.

If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $100. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the NSORG program and which grant applications have been approved to receive funding. As a volunteer with Open/Nebraska, my request is to educate the citizens of our state. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.

The Nebraska Public Records Law requires a response time of four business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.

If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

Jay Hannah
